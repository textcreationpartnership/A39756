            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſad ſubject and ſo much the ſadder that few are found whoſe eye affecteth their heart, whoſe teares, and groaning ſeem to anſwer ſuch a ſtroke, and ruin which now is like to fall under our hand, but I shall leave this; prayer will be the beſt cure, and is this day more fit, then complaining, to turn unto him who ſeeth the wayes of his People that he may heal them, and can prevent theſe with mercy, who ſeem leaſt fit for the ſame; onely two or three ſad remarks of this time, I cannot altogether paſſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are ſtrange ſymptomes of the Churches preſent caſe, and diſtemper. 1. To ſee men own the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſanctification, who yet can profeſſedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, yea, make it their work by reproach to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a prejudice againſt the practice thereof, Oh ſtrange! to finde ſuch as will dip their pen in gall againſt a tender and ſtrict walk in Religion, and revile it in the power thereof, whileſt they doe not deny theſe truths, and principles that neceſſarily oblidge to ſuch a tender practice; who in the moſt grave concerning dutyes of Chriſtianity think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to charge their brethen with Phariſaical oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and hypocriſy; whileſt they muſt confeſſe theſe duetyes to be unqueſtionably binding, and that they can be no competent judges of ſuch a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, which the great witnes of the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of men can onely determine. 2. It is a
<pb facs="tcp:44187:4"/> ſad remark alſo of the time that Proteſtant writers, profeſſing the Reformed Religion, shall ſtate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in oppoſition to the moſt concerning grounds thereof, ſuch as imputed righteouſnes, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, which are well called <hi>Articulus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; cadentis Eceleſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> right the other in order to the actual participation of that right, yea, that holines is abſolutly neceſſary not only <hi>neceſſitate praecepti, ſed medii,</hi> and juſtifying faith doth neceſſarily require works, <hi>ſed non qua, &amp; quatenus juſtificat,</hi> but ſure, if theſe men grant we are juſtifyed by the ſatiſfaction of Chriſt, they muſt needs confeſſe it is by imputation, ſince if the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour be acquit by the cautioners payment, is it not by the imputation there of to him? O ſad! to ſee ſome put their invention upon the rack how to wound the Church (yea, a death wound it would be if they could reach their end) in that great truth of imputed righteouſnes, but it were beſt they denyed that ſixt ver. of the 4. Chap. to the Rom. to be canonick Scripture, which none can read and shift, it being ſo clear, that the bleſſed man is there held forth, <hi>uuto whom God imputeth righteouſnes without works,</hi> ſure that cannot be inherent righteouſnes, elſe
<pb facs="tcp:44187:4"/> it were <hi>contradictio in adjecto,</hi> I profeſſe theſe, what ever they pretend, I muſt look on as adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes to the Reformed Churches, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dangerous then a pirat going forth under a counterfut flag. 3. Is it not likewiſe ſad, yea, aſtonishing to ſee Miniſters now in theſe times, who are the expreſſe Embaſſadors of Chriſt given to the Church for her edification, ſtand ſo directly croſſe to the very end of their work and Miniſtry, many of whom may be ſaid that knowingly, and deliberatly they oppoſe piety, that ſuch should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, whoſe work is to feed, and wound in ſtead of healing, grieve the ſpirit of the Godly, who should be helpers of their joy, that none are a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plague to corrupt the Church, and cauſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Lord be abhorred, then ſome of theſe who should be the falt of the earth, yea, none more obſtruct the treaty of the Goſpel, betwixt Chriſt and his Church, then Miniſters who are called the friends of the bridgroom, Oh, what a ſtrange and aſtonishing contradiction may this ſeem, but it should be no reproach to that holy, and excellent calling of the Miniſtry, for of ſuch the Scripture hath expreſly warned. I confeſſe it may be ſaid no Atheiſt like an unſanctified Miniſter, yea, no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme of ſo black a dye as theirs, who being ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured with holy things have yet no ſenſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Now in this very dark houre, wherein the Church ſeemeth to have fallen in a death like pang, and oh, many of her Children in a ſad l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thargie, that if we looked in an ordinary way, her wound might ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable, there are a great and concerning Quaeries
<pb facs="tcp:44187:5"/> that I think should much take us up. The one is to know what the Scripture ſpeaketh to the Church, what ſolid ground of encouragement is there held forth, for truely if we had not that ſure teſtimony of the Word, we might fear Religion should quite wear out, and truth perish from the earth, but doth the Scripture ſpeak peace? all then is well; that, O that is ſufficient ſecurity to put the Churches hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond further debate, though men should threaten, though the earth were overturned, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shaken, this is a determination above men, above all the rules of humane policy, yea, above the ſtars, which fruſtrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad, even that revealed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, taking place anent his work and People.</p>
            <p>I knw ſome grave writers of theſe late times, doe expreſſe their fear that the horrid wickedneſſe &amp; apoſtacy of the Gentile Church may at laſt reſolve in the Lords departure and an univerſal darknes, that as the rejection of the Jewes made way for the Gentiles incoming, ſo their fall may as remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preceede that ſolemn return and reſtauration of the Jewish Church, it is alſo become the fear of many that Popery may yet once overrun the whole Reformed Churches before Antichriſt fall: but ſince theſe ſad thoughts, nor any appearances of the time, are no part of our Bible, we should learn neither to ſtretch our fears nor expectations, beyond that which the Scripture warranteth, and if the Lord be God, and this his very word, let us adhere to it and wait for its accomplishment. A 2. Quaere which is ndeed no leſſe concerning in ſuch a time, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:44187:5"/> 
               <hi>Duety,</hi> what ſo imminent an liazard of the Church, and this great decay of Chriſtianity doth moſt preſſingly call for, but this is a ſubject which requireth another pen, and too large, to touch with a paſſing word, yea, we may ſay the great want of theſe dayes is not anent the diſcovery of duety, but of the practice of known, and diſcovered duetyes, for the Scripture giveth a certain and diſtinct ſound in the darkeſt time, and hath not left us to doubtful inquiries and debate in this matter, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave it with a few things onely to be in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſidered. 1. It is ſure, that every time hath its preſent duety, and the wiſe diſcerners thereof will knw thence what they ought to do, what work and ſervice the preſent circumſtances of that time cals for, shall the earth have its ſeaſons wherein things are beautiful, shall the ſtork and ſwallow know their time, and yet Chriſtians not know how to bring forth fruit in their ſeaſon, and diſcern the ſpecial time and opportunity of duety? 2. It is alſo ſure, that every Chriſtian in whatſoever capacity or condition as he hath his meaſure and talent, ſo hath ſome work and opportunity of duety, wherein they may ſerve the Lord in their generation, yea, it is not the meaneſt lot or condition that shutteth that door upon any, that they have no work for God, who deſire to be faithful for him: Oh that in this threatning time when darknes is like to overſpread the Church, it were more upon the heart of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſtrive together, and contend by a ſerious improvement of their ſeveral capacities to preſerve Religion, and tranſmit the knowledge of Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:44187:6"/> Chriſt to the poſterity, that the Chriſtian parent, or Maſter of family did witnes more that great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a time when many are drawing back, <hi>but as for me, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> 3. It is found that the moſt eminent and honourable ſervice of the Church doth uſually tryſt her in a low and ſuffering condition, when there hath been but little ſtrength, many outward diſadvantages, then both their call and furniture hath been moſt obſervable, to confeſſe the truth, to endure for the Goſpel of Chriſt, to overcome by the Word of his teſtimony, a piece of ſervice whereto more proſperous times doe not give ſuch an opportunity, yea, it hath been in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11: 32. that theſe who knew their God, were made ſtrong to do exploits. 4. It doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to put a high value on the truth in a time when men muſt either loſe it, or buy it, and O what a choiſe purchaſe is that which cannot be bought too dear, though at the rate of our liberty, eſtate, credit and reputation, yea with the loſſe of peace when it cometh in competition with it?

<pb facs="tcp:44187:6"/> and witneſſing of a few for the truth in a ſpait of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick defection, to keep it alive, when it was like to be ſwallowed up, yea, to effects above rational beliefe, <hi>unus Athanaſius contratotum orbem,</hi> many ſuch remarks have not been wanting. 6. I shall only adde that which is alwayes neceſſary and binding, yet, we may ſay in a time of the Churches hazard and ſuffering is more preſſingly called for, even the ſtudy of Chriſtian prudence, a duety convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly neceſſary, for regulating of duetyes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the circumſtances of the Churches caſe, which doth ſo nearly concern the intereſt and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, that I muſt ſay, a breach in that concord betwixt zeal and Chriſtian prudence, when there is not ſome equal reſpect ſtudyed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of both, cannot but give the Church a ſore wound, this is indeeda large theam, but I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point at in 3 things. 1. In our avoiding and being tender to give offence, not only to keep a diſtance from evil, but from the ſmalleſt appearance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I muſt ſay they are bad caſuits, and have litle reſpect to the Churches edification, who make it their work, not ſo much to keep men from ſin, as to shew them, <hi>quam prope ad peccatum ſine peccato acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere liceat,</hi> O what a becoming fear is that, not to lay a ſtumbling block in the way of others, to grieve the weake, or confirm ſuch who uſe to found their prejudice againſt the truth, and way of God, upon the miſcariage of ſuch as profeſſe the ſame. 2. This excellent ſtudy of Chriſtian prudence hath a reſpect to mens taking offence as well as their giving it, to our being ſober in judging, in perſonal reflexions,
<pb facs="tcp:44187:7"/> to cover and hide the infirmities of others rather then ſpread them, even for the Goſpels ſake, yea, to shut as it were our eyes, and caſt a mantle on their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who overtaken with the violence of ſome temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may yet be ſerviceable to the Church, but eſpecially this should preſſe us to a watchful regard of any breach, and rent in the Church, and to ſtudy a healing ſpirit ſo far as is poſſible without prejudice to truth. 3. It is alſo a concerning piece of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence, hovv to vvalk vviſely tovvards theſe vvho are vvithout, vvhen prejudice againſt the vvay of God is now in ſuch a grouth, to ſtudy hovv vve may convince, gain ground, and by Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prudent and tender carriage conciliat reſpect to the truth, and thus commend holines, and theſe vvho profeſſe it to the conſcience of men, to ſtudy that rule of expediency much in things of themſelves vvarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, vvhat fitnes, and advantage, preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may offer, or deny for edification, and promoting that great intereſt of the Goſpel in our converſe vvith men.</p>
            <p>I shall novv ceaſe to trouble yovv further, onely vvould premit ſome fevv things vvith a reſpect to the ſubject of this follovving eſſay. 1. Should vve not vvith vvonder and aſtonishment look on this great record of the Scripture? by vvhich the glorious Majeſty of God doth ſpeak to men, yea doth as certainly communicat his Counſel and minde, vve may ſay more certainly, then if vve had an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat audible voice from Heaven, O could vve have ſuch ordinary thoughts of this, if vve conſider hovv near God cometh therein to us? I think if there
<pb facs="tcp:44187:7"/> vvere but one corner of the earth, though in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt parts, vvhere men might go and get a look of ſo vvonderful, and important a thing as Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vvill vvritten and ſent from Heaven to the earth, anent our duety here, and bleſſednes for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, should vve not think it vvorth our croſſing the ſea, and of the greateſt expence of time or labour? it is truely a vvonder hovv vve can read and conſider the Scripture, vvithout vvondring. 2. It is a great concernment to knovv that the Scripture hath ſuch a vvitnes as experience, and that there is ſuch a trade, &amp; correſpondence as this betvvixt the Saints and the Word, vvhich lieth not in the common road of the World. O vvhat an empty thing should Religion be if it had not this vvord <hi>experience</hi> in its grammar, that ſecret &amp; ſure mark vvhereby the Chriſtian knovveth the Scripture is of God, hovv thus the Lord hath oft ſealed their inſtruction in a dark plunge; hovv life and povver, inlivening influences, to the melting of their heart, hath oft tryſted them there in a very dead frame; and novv they knovv that verily God heareth prayer, novv they are perſvvaded, and have learned by the croſſe that he is indeed a comforter, yea, many can shevv hovv by the Word their firſt acquaintance vvith the Lord did begin, hovv ſome particular truth, like a pickle of corn throvvn in at their heart, by the bleſſing of the great husbandman vvas made to take life, and grovv. 3. It much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us to knovv vvhat an excellent key the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to unlock that ſealed book of providence, and that no other key can fit the ſame, many have tried another vvay but loſt themſelves on the ſearch, and
<pb facs="tcp:44187:8"/> the more they preſt by humane vviſdome, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the more dark. I truely think there is not a more ſatisfying diſcovery vvithin time, then this, to trace divine truth back until vve ſee its firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth out of his eternal decree and council who is the author thereof, hovv thence it taketh hold of the vvord vvhich is the adequate ſign, and declaration of his purpoſe, and then hovv the vvord taketh hold of his vvork and providence, vvhere vve may ſee the face and condition of the Church clearly vvritten out through all the changes of time, hovv providence keepeth a certain and ſteady courſe even amidſt the moſt perplexed motions and reelings of of the earth, yea, hovv all things even theſe vvhich vvould ſeem moſt contradictory, run vvithin that ſtraight channel of the vvord, and cannot go vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:44187:8"/> termes are. 5. We vvould upon no accompt shut our eares vvhere the Scripture is clear, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us ground to vvait that the outgoings of the Lord for his people in their deliverance, and for the deſtruction of his enemyes novv in theſe laſt times, shall be very glorious, yea by ſome ſtately and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious acts of providence that he shall accomplish his judgement on Antichriſt: neither muſt vve take a prejudice at truth, becauſe of the vvilde fancyes of many vvho vvould extend it beyond its bounds, or that near reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mblance vvhich the errour of ſome in this time may ſeem to have thereto, for that hath been an old ſtratagem of the Devil to prejudge the World at ſome of the truths of God, by ſetting up a counterfut thereto. I shall adde no more, onely vvhat accompt is given upon the cloſe of the laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of ſome remarkable paſſages of providence in the late times, as herein the author hath ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to profeſſe he did endeavour vvhat could be attained for certainty of the ſame, and if any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe relations should be found a miſtake, he dare ſay before Him vvho is greater then our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it vvas not the neglect of a ſerious inquiry, ſo he muſt alſo premit, the inſerting of them vvas upon no further intent, then to be a vvitnes to that truth of <hi>the Lords eminent appearance for his Church in the laſt dayes:</hi> it vvould be of great uſe and profit to the Church that ſome more fitly qualified vvould ſtudy a more large collection of this kinde.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two meanes by which the bleſſed Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God hath choſen, to reveal himſelf to the ſons of men, his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> which may be called theſe two great Luminaries, for giving light to the Church, though the one be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I mean doth more clearly shine forth, yea doth communicate light to the other; theſe, men muſt not divide, which by ſo ſtrait a tye the Lord hath joyned, and by a mervellous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence hath ſet the one over againſt the other, that it may be eaſy to ſee his faithfulnes, and the <hi>accomplishment of the Scripture</hi> therein, and indeed this is a great concerning truth, that calleth for a ſerious ſtudy, the ſolid perſuaſion of which should affoord a ſvveet ground of repoſe, and reſt for the ſoul, though the earth were all in a combuſtion ronnd about, and give a ſatisfying anſwer to our moſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous thoughts, and feares: Now this being the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubject of the following diſcourſe, I shall firſt touch it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44187:10"/> a little in the general, and then hold forth ſome more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grounds, whence it may be clearly demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the <hi>Scripture of God hath a certain accomplishment here in the World,</hi> and what is to be underſtood by the ſame, I shall endeavour to clear in theſe things, which would be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is the very unfolding of the Lords decree, and ſecret purpoſe, the bringing forth of his work, now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, to the view of Angels and Men, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the deep of his thoughts, and counſel from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is an opening up of the ſealed book, which we muſt not underſtand to be that ſecret roll of election, and the book of life, wherein the names of the elect are writ; but <hi>Liber fatidicus,</hi> the ſealed book of Gods diſpenſations in the World, shewing out his counſels, and deſignes which should be brought forth in the after ages of time; for as the Lord did fully comprehend what he was to do, and all that was to befal his Church, and People from the beginning to the end, long long before there was a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the mountaines were formed, ſo hath he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed, and written out his heart in the Word hereanent, wherein he hath moſt plainly shewed forth, what were his bleſſed purpoſes, and counſel of old, and thus the thoughts of his heart, his Word and his works do ſweetly aggree, and each one wonderfully anſwers to another, for his work doth bring forth, and accomplish his Word, that his decree, and counſel from all eternity may take place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures accomplishment is the tranſcript and writing of it over in providence, where we may ſee and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire how the Word doth shine upon all the pathes and footſteps of the Lord toward his Church in every age, and gives light to the ſame, and what an evident reflection, his work hath again upon the Word, ſo that through the whole ſeries and courſe of providence in the earth, we have a moſt exact portraicture, and image of the Scripture, anſwering one to another as face anſwers to face in the glaſſe, where it may be eaſy to diſcern the copy by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44187:10"/> principale, and that reſemblance which is betwixt the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that excellent pattern, and model, which is held forth thereof in the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The accomplishment of the Scripture is the very turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was the object of our faith, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to be the object of our ſenſe and feeling, it is the real birth, and bringing forth theſe truths unto the World in their appointed time and ſeaſon concerning the Church, and particular Chriſtians, which were hid in that womb of the promiſe, and many dark predictions of the Word; it is ſuch a thing as giveth the promiſes and Prophecyes, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible being, yea bringeth truth ſo near within the reach of our ſenſes, that we may even touch as it were and handle the Words of life. O what an excellent interpreter is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience! <hi>Tast and ſee,</hi> for thus the ſerious Chriſtian gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a view of the Scripture, and ſpiritual things, which the moſt ſubtil, and piercing eye of unſanctified Schoolmen cannot reach, yea, by the practice of truth, nearnes to God, ahd retiring of the ſoul to him, hath oft got more light in ane houre then others by many dayes, putting their judgement and invention upon the rack.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is Gods own ſeale, which he pntteth to the Word to confirm and ratify the ſame, I do not only mean that ſecret ſeale of the Spirit within, but ſomething more external that ſolemn teſtimony of his workes, whereby he doth every day appeal mens conſciences anent his truth, for his works are very manifeſt, whereon there is ſo clear an ingravening of his truth and faithfulneſs, that as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and image of the ſeal is upon the wax, men may alſo ſee whoſe ſuperſcription and image that is, which doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on ſuch, and ſuch paſſages of providences.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is ſomething we are not to ſeek onely in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acts of providence, or in any ſingular and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent path of a chriſtian experience, nay it doth shine forth in the ſmalleſt and moſt caſual things that falls out, yea in every Page of that great Volumn of providence may be clearly read.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Scriptures accomplishment is ſuch a thing as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44187:11"/> concerns every Chriſtian in his perſonal caſe, to which his ordinary experience doth relate, whereof theſe have a large regiſter, what of the Word hath been certainly proven in the ſeveral ſteps, and changes of their life, whoſe practice doth much ly betwixt improvement of the Word, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation how it is fulfilled, ſuch can witnes how under a ſpiritual decay to be carnally minded is death, and when its well, that great peace they have who love Gods Law, they have oft found that in a ſtrait he is a very preſent help, and in the way of duty that its ſurely good to draw near to him, and in the cloſe of their life, can from many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and convincing providences declare the truth, and faithfulnes of God; and truely whilſt I ſpeak here, of the Chriſtians experience, I think its ſad, and a great short coming, that there is not a more ſerious improvement of it for this end, which is a very concerning duty on ſuch who have taſted that the Lord is gracious, &amp; O what an excellent addition would this be to their teſtament, when they are to leave the World, to leave a teſtimony behinde them to the faithfulnes of God in his Word, and promiſe, and thus put their ſeale to the ſame, from what they have oft proven by ſure experience, for this should prove a ſingular help to ſtrengthen others, and ſpread abroad the fame, and good report of religion, yea, thus one generation should declare the works of the Lord to another, and tranſmit the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his goodnes to ſucceding ages.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This is ſomething which not only the Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth witnes, and in every time take place, but hath alſo a peculiar reference to theſe ages, and periods of times, wherein ſuch particular truths, should have their accomplishment; for its true that the Prophets of old did not onely in their predictions, hold forth in general, the truth, and certainty of theſe things, which should fall out, but they alſo inquired and ſearched diligently anent the time to what or what manner of time the Spirit by them, did point at <hi>1 Pet. 1: 11.</hi> For its truely clear, that a piece of the Word, was under the Law to have its peculiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, that part of it alſo, under the Meſſias
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44187:11"/> Kingdome, in the dayes of the goſpel, should be fulfilled, and we find a very concerning part thereof belongs to thir latter times; and there is betwixt ſuch periods of time, and revolution of the Churches caſe, and the bringing forth of ſuch a piece of the Scripture, to a performance, a very certain and undoubted connection. Its true we do not yet well underſtand (which will be one of the laſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Church shall have at the end of time, when the myſtery of God is finished) how to ſort the event exactly to the Word, but it is ſure (and were worthy of our ſtudy and obſervation) how every age hath ſomething of the Scripture peculiar thereto, yea carrieth forward the Lords work and deſign a further ſtep, may we not ſee how one age fulfilleth ſuch a piece of the Churches ſufferings appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her, and puts ſome great tryal and ſad perſecution over her head; which she was to meet with, whilſt an other age, carrieth her thorow an other change, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her a time of reſt and breathing, how ſuch a time bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Antichriſt fordward to his hight, and ſuch a following age begins the turn of the Churches caſe, yea every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral period and revolution of time, ſtill addeth ſomething, to that excellent hiſtory of the Word, and providence, which we have ſince the beginning, and bringeth forth ſomething further into the world of the Lords counſel and deſign about his Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The accomplishing of the Scripture is ſuch a thing, we are to look after, in a ſpecial way here, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this militant, and traveling condition of the Church, for if the Scriptures were once fully accomplished, and the great myſtery of God therein finished, there were then nothing more to doe, his work of providence were at an end, and time should be no more; this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that is not here perfected at once, but is ſtill gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually carrying on, and then shall be compleat at the reſurrection of the juſt, and ſecond coming of the Lord, which is the laſt part of Canonick Scripture to be made out, when both his work and his word, and time, shall be all finished together; but whill the ſainets are yet by the way,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44187:12"/> they have the written word and all theſe pretious promiſes therein, for preſent uſe and encouragement, for that is its proper work to take them ſafe thorow this labyrinth of the world, and when it hath brought them to land, it hath no more to doe, there will be then no more need for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to goe to a promiſe, and adventure upon it, we shall then no more watch, with the watchmen in a dark, and ſtormy night, and hope for the breaking of the day, faith then shall not be at a ſtand, how ſuch a word shall be made out, becauſe of invincible difficulties in its way, no, then it hath done its worke, and that which is written shall be ſwallowed up, in that which is ſeen and enjoyed, all the ſtreames of our encouragement will then loſe themſelves in a greater depth. O then its finished and done what all the promiſes, prophecies, and threatnings of the Word, was bringing forth, and then no more need of ſomething as a pledge and earneſt in hand, to them who have the full poſſeſſion of the inheritance, under whoſe feet the God of peace hath trod Satan and all their enemies.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I shall adde this, the accomplishment of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſomething, which is not onely demonſtrat to a Chriſtian by ſenſible influences, and Gods Secret working with his Spirit, but is made out to the obſervation of men, in the way of providence, and not onely witneſſed by that internal evidence of the Spirit, but by an external teſtimony, which both rationally, holdeth this out to the judgement, and ſenſibly to the ſight and experience, and this is the ſtrongeſt and moſt full of all outward evidences, ſince the world muſt shut their eyes if they do not ſee it, and a Chriſtian muſt deny what he both ſeeth and feeleth, if he deny a witnes to this.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We would conſider the <hi>accomplishment of the Scripture,</hi> as that which <hi>is the Lords peculiar work and deſign in the World,</hi> and that great buſſines which is upon the wheels of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence amidſt the various changes and revolutions, which are here within time, for bringing about whereof the bleſſed thoughts of his heart, are fixed and unalterable.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44187:12"/> This is indeed a grave and ſerious truth worthy to be more noticed and laid to heart by men, that the glorious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God which goeth throughout the earth, and doth particularly reach all things which come to paſſe, the ſmalleſt as well as the greateſt intreſts of men, in all theſe, doth move certainly and infallibly for the accomplishing of the Scripture, which is that great thing God hath before his eyes, for it is no perſonal intreſts of men how great ſo ever they be, that can anſwer this end, it is ſomething beyond the Setting up of Kings, or overturning King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations that he doth minde amidſt theſe varions changes, which are in the World, its ſome greater thing, then that which we moſt notice, the Lord thereby deſignes, how ſuch a party is advanced, and others brought low, for theſe things come within the reach of his care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in ſo far as the fulfilling of the Scripture is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in concerned; the outmaking of the promiſes, and thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnings one ſyllabe whereof he doth more value then all the crounes and Kingdomes of the earth, yea will not let it fall to the ground, though it should be at the rate of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cities, and countries deſolate, for its in this the Lord taketh pleaſure, and exerciſeth his bleſſed thoughts, even the bringing about what he hath ſpoken in his Word.</p>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Now to clear this furder, I shall hold forth theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing grounds, whence it may appear.</p>
            <p>Firſt the fulfilling of the Scripture, and written Word is ſo great a thing, and of ſuch concernment, that the bleſſed Majeſty of God, thought it worthy of a place in his heart from all eternity, this was before him in his thoughts and counſels of old; even that mervalous work which should be the after-product, and outmaking of his Word to his Church here within time, and ſurely was ſuch a plott and contrivance that as no leſſe then infinit love, wiſedome and power, was required to bring it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſo it was well becoming the Majeſty of God, and worthy to be the work of all the three bleſſed perſons of the trinity; O if we could go doun a little to this deep, and ſee the wonders that are there, we would find that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44187:13"/> knowledge which uſually leſſeneth our admiration of other things, would highten it here, it would be new to us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to think how great and mervelous a thing that is which the Word is bringing forth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is upon this, even the performance of the Word that the preſent encouragement, and after bleſſednes of the ſaints dothly, for the great intereſt of the Church is adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon the Word, and embarked with it, which should be loſt yea their ſtock and treaſure which is laid up in heaven, and all that a Chriſtian is worth, which is layd up in the promiſe, were then perished, if the Scripture should want an accomplishment, the Godly man hath then run &amp; labourned in vain, &amp; theſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt have dyed in a ſad deluſion, providence would be like the work of the foolish builder, who begun and knew not how to finish. O how heighly then is the Lord concerned in fulfilling of his Word? That he may perfect what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his People, and having ſurely payed the price put them alſo in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is yet more then the intereſts of Angels and men, yea then heaven and earth is worth that depends upon the outmaking of the Scripture; the glory of God and eſpecially the praiſe of that great attribute his <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which he will have no leſſe shine forth in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Word, then his power and wiſdome in this great fabrick of the univerſe, and theſe mervelous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature; for he hath magnified his Word above all his works, therefore is his heart greatly ſet upon this, even the bringing to paſſe what he hath ſpoken, which if in the leaſt should faill, were no leſſe then to make God a lyer, and falſify his Word, who is through all the Church known by this bleſſed name, <hi>The God of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We would conſider this, as that great truſt, which is put in his hand who onely in heaven and earth was found worthy to open the book of Gods decrees and counſels, and looſe the ſeals thereof, a truſt which the Lord did not adventure upon the Angels, the ſmalleſt promiſe, being ſuch as requires no leſſe then an omnipotent power and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44187:13"/> arme of <hi>Ithovah</hi> to bring it about; for which end, he whom the father hath anointed, is gone forth as a mighty man who rejoyceth to run his race, that he may perform his Word, and through this great deſign in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of providence, about his Church and People which he will not ceaſe or give over, until the myſtery of God in the Scripture, and all that was ſpoken by the Prophets be put to a cloſe, when Heaven and Earth at the pouring out of the laſt vial, shal give that ſolemn shout and exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>It is finished, it is finished.</hi> O if this were once fully perfect, there would be no more to do, then the Winter were paſt, and the Summer come, the ſong of Moſes and the lamb should be heard, becauſe the bride hath made herſelfe ready, then let al the trees of the wood rejoyce, the hills break forth into ſinging, and all that is therein be glade, becauſe the Scripture and great deſign thereof is fully finished, and the day of the perfect liberty of the Sonnes of God is come.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The accomplishment of the Scripture is of ſuch concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that nothing can be done until it be once finished, for this, time muſt wait, the Sun muſt keep its courſe, and the ordinances of the Heaven continue as they are, the World is but a ſcaffold until this building be perfected, for this the grave doth ſtill retain her priſoners and the duſt of the Saints muſt yet reſt in hope, the creation ſtill groaneth, and the marriage ſupper of the lamb is deferred, the cry of the ſouls under the altar get not a full return, until all that is written in the Word be fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We would conſider, this is the great thing which the Lord this day is carrying on, even the accomplishment of his Word, for this is moſt brought upon debate, of any thing beſides; the World challengeth it, and the hearts of the godly do oft call it in queſtion; the Atheiſt ſcoffs at it, and ſayeth where is the promiſe of his coming, there are often to appearance inſuperable difficulties in the way of its performance, therefore doth the Majeſty of God ſo much concern himſelf in this, for bringing about of which he is in a holy way reſtles, and providence in an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44187:14"/> uuceſſant motion, until he hath done that which he hath ſpoken in his Word. It was for this cauſe that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be accomplished, that the Word was made flesh, and he who counted it no robbery to be equal unto God, did take upon himſelf the forme of a Servant, this is of ſuch account in his eyes, that what time he ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Nation or People, ere it come not to paſſc, he will rather put forth omnipotency, for the working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and change the very courſe of nature, for this he wil make the deep dry, make a way through the red Sea, and cauſe I ordan ſtand as in heapes, that he may keep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his People; if there be no way for bringing about his Word, but through a Sea of blood, and over the bones and carcaſſes of his enemyes, he will do it, and bring it to paſſe, though Walled Cities, and the Sonnes of Anack mighty and ſtrong should ſtand in the way thereof. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams old age, and Sarahs dead womb, muſt not fruſtrat this, if the promiſe of the Churches reſtauration cannot be made out without a wonder shewed upon dry bones ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at the graves mouth, this shall not be wanting; when God ſayeth he'll bring down the enemyes of his Church, if the duſt of the ground should ariſe, down they muſt come; how many great deſigns of men hath this bleſſed deſign (that the counſel of the Lord may ſtand) crusht and broken? ſo that their work and counſel hath been as the Spiders web, when it ſtood croſſe to this end, the godly need not fear, that he be not a preſent help in time of trouble, for he will keep his word herein, though the Earth should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and the Mountaines caſt into the midſt of the Sea; O who hath reſiſted his counſel! What are all theſe viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes and changes here in the World? But making way for the Scriptures accomplishment, with what deſire doth he move towards this end? So that as in <hi>Zachary 6: v. 8.</hi> the inſtruments by him appointed for executing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the threatnings of the Word, its ſaid they have quieted his Spirit, his decrees are mountaines of braſſe, which are unchangeable, the thoughts of his heart take place in all generations, therefore the Word Which is gone forth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44187:14"/> out of his mouth shall not return in vain, but the pleaſure of the Lord shall proſper in his hand</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The accomplishment of the Scripture is a truth very clear and manifest,</hi> whereof none can pretend ignorance, if they doe not shut their eyes, and force their own light from the fear of ſuch a diſcovery; for the obſtruction doth not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly in the darknes of the obiect or that men cannot ſee this, ſince we have it ſo clearly held forth in great and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible charecters, nay, we muſt ſay the cauſe is culpable, there is much of the will in it, which renders ſuch ane ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance without excuſe. O that this should be ſo little lookt after, a matter of ſuch near and weighty concern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, when there needs not an other demonſtration, but <hi>come and ſee</hi> the works of the Lord through the earth, for he hath here ſo far condiſcended to his People, to bring the truth near, that they even feel and grip the ſame, yea doth in a manner ſay to every one as to Thomas, <hi>put in your bands,</hi> touch the Word, and truth thereof, and be no longer faithles, taſt but and ſee, that the Lord is good and that he is true in what he hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>We are indeed to look after a more clear, and full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this truth the nearer the Church is to the end of time; there is a labyrinth as it were of turnings and windings, through which we may ſee the Word oft brought, ſo as we loſe ſight thereof, and are ready to ſtagger anent its perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; but its as true that the moſt eminent confirmations, the ſaints ever had of this truth, hath been after greateſt shakings thereanent, yea, the Lord hath in all ages, ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſealed his Word by its performance, that we may ſay, can he be a Chriſtian and a ſtranger to this in his experience, and a ſerious on-looker on providence and the diſpenſations of the time, wherein he lives, and a ſtranger to it, in his obſervation; yea, can any be ſo wholly brutish, not to diſcern a thing ſo clear that oftimes theſe, who run, may read?</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak a little more to this I shall here point at ſome things, that may shew how manifeſt this truth is.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44187:15"/>1. Is it not very clear, which we ſee very day, brings to light? A truth ſo conſpicuous, both in Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way with his Church, and in the ſeveral ſteps and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a Chriſtians life: For theſe mercies which bring the Word, and promiſe to paſſe, are new every morning, and cry aloud, if we could hear, great is his faithfulnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, this is indeed tryed; and needs there more, to convince a blind man, that his ſight is reſtored to him, but that he certainly ſeeth; ſure they never wanted confirmations here who do but ſerviouſly ſeek to be confirmed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not a clear truth, which not onely is found upon the exacteſt tryal; but is witneſſed by ſuch who ever tryed it in their moſt preſſing ſtraits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and extremity; for its in the darkeſt night this truth hath moſt brightly shined, and theſe more remarkable ventorious acts of faith, have they not ſtill brought forth moſt convincing experiments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent? We may ſay there is none can give a better account of the performance of the Word, then theſe who againſt hope, have beleeved in hope, that this never made them ashamed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo clear, whereof there are ſuch ſolemn extraordinary comfirmations in all ages? For that his name is near, his wondrous works declare, I am ſure no time could ever deny its witnes, how by great convincing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, both of judgement and mercy it hath been ſo ſealed, as hath forced Atheiſts to keep Silence, no time wherein the Church had not cauſe to erect a pillar, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave thereon, <hi>We have ſeen with our eyes</hi> the great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works of the Lord, by which he hath witneſſed the truth of his Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not a manifeſt truth which even in the moſt ſtrange, and dark footſteps of providence, ſo clearly shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth forth, theſe which at the firſt look are an aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hard to be underſtood, yet after moſt clearly verify the Scripture, that whilſt the Lords way goeth out of our ſight, yea, out of the ordinary road of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through a labyrinth of turnings, and croſſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet at length, it doth evidently clear, and diſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44187:15"/> it ſelfe, which men may oft ſee break forth as the ſun out of a dark cloud, that shiueth the more brightly, the more it was obſcured.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Is it not very clear which can be demonſtrated by ſuch viſible effects in theſe great changes of the World? For the fulfilling of the Scripture, is not a thing hid in a corner, but oft published in the houſe tops, that men may ſee legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly written, upon Kingdomes and nations, the deſolate ruines, and deva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ation of cities &amp; houſes great, and fair, which are made to be without inhabitants, ſo as theſe who go by may clearly read the cauſe, and bear that witnes, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thereis ſin viſibly punished according to the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. How clear is this, which we have ſo evidently drawen out, and acted over in a Chriſtian walk? For what elſe is the ſpiritual converſation of ſuch, theſe viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and evidences of the grace of God all along a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians way, but a viſible convincing witnes to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the word? Hath not ſuch a very audible Echo, and reſound to that which is the great drift, and Scope of the Scripture; where men may ſee the bible turnd over into a practical hiſtory, written forth, and acted on the heart, and converſation of the ſaints, as on a ſtage, or theatre: the Word living, ſpeaking, moving, and clearly diffuſing it ſelfe through all the veines, as it were, and conduits of a Chriſtians life, ſo that if the truth, and reality of the grace of God be a thing manifeſt, and unqueſtionable, we muſt alſo ſee therein the reall performance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I shall adde we may clearly ſee how one piece of the Scripture, is nothing elſe but the punctual fulfilling, and accomplishment of the other, how that which was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by dark types, under the Law, and held in a Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, through the Old Teſtament, is written before our eyes in a plain, and real hiſtory in the New Teſtament, and that the goſpel is only a perfecting of the Law, and the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44187:16"/>IV. Though its very manifeſt and by undenyable proofs can be demonſtrated that the Scripture hath a real accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and doth certainly take place, in the conſtant courſe of providence here in the World, that I am ſure if men do not darken themſelves they can be no ſtrangers to ſuch a thing, yet we muſt ſay <hi>This truth which most nearly concerns us, is to the most of men,</hi> (even ſuch who ſeem to give a large aſſent to the Word) <hi>a myſtery and dark riddle.</hi> There are few who doe but enquire if there be ſuch a thing, if the promiſes and threatnings have indeed a certain outmaking, few doe ſeriouſly ponder the providences of God in which the truth and faithfulnes of the Word shineth forth, that they may thereby be furder confirmed, we ſee that to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (alace too many) the great concernments of the Law and everlaſting happines are a trivial and an impertinent buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, this is a truth the World doth paſſe without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſuch as ſport at Religion when they come to earneſt here, dare not ſtand before this diſcovery, it concerneth them much to reconcile their principles with their practice, their fear begetteth hatred, and both put their wit and invention on the rack, how to diſpute away any remander of a conſcience, to impriſon their light, and under the pretext of reaſon, run down godlineſs, and the abſolute neceſſity thereof, yea, beſids doth not ſenſuality wherein many wallow, and ſteep themſelves, ſo dull and droun the ſoul, put ſuch ane interpoſition of the Earth betwixt them, and this truth, as wholly darkens it? And, oh, how ſad that many having a large profeſſion to be Chriſtians ſcarce ever knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it is to put the Word to ane eſſay, and tryal in the concernments of their life, to have their light followed with experience, wherein the very truth, and reality of Religion lieth.</p>
            <p>To clear this, I shall hold forth ſome things which may shew how little this truth of the Scriptures accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is known, or ſtudied by the moſt of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The abounding of ſo much Atheiſme that there are ſo many who not onely diſclaim the practice of that Religion they ſeem to profeſs, but do ſtate themſelves in moſt direct
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44187:16"/> oppoſition to the rules, and principles thereof, theſe to whom the Scripture is but as a Romance, yea, doe onely converſe therewith to prove their wit, and parts in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging the ſame, who avowedly mock at the judgements, and providences of God; I confeſs theſe may be reckoned monſters, a very prodigy in the time, wherein they live, though alace, it is not the leaſt part of the World; and which is ſtrange, we ſee the moſt horrid Atheiſts do uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abound, were the light of the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath moſt shined, the ſavage places of the Earth bring forth no ſuch monſtrous birth, as are hatcht within the viſible Chutch, for thus the judgment of God putteth a blacker dye on them then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; O what a terrible ſound should the fulfilling of the Scripture, have in mens eares, if they once came to have ſerious thoughts thereof, ſince they cannot admit this but they muſt certainly read their own ſentence of death, which a few dayes shall put in execution, and if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be true, they are then unſpeakably miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That indifferency whieh we ſee amongſt men about Religion, and the moſt concerning truths of Scripture doth shew how little this is knowen or laid to heart, whence there is ſuch a generation who doe not profeſſedly deny the Scripture, yet can turn it over in a Schoole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, and wonders that men should engadge ſo far upon it; it is not that it is hid from them, but they truly choiſe to hide themſelves from it, as more ſuitable to that intereſt, they drive, that the truth of God, should be rather a matter of opinion then of faith, a thing which they would diſpute, but not beleeve, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O, what other thoughts would a clear ſight of this cauſe? That within ſo few dayes, the truths, and threatnings of the Word, shall be ſad earneſt, the fulfilling whereof no sharpnes of wit, nor ſubtil arguments, will be able to evade.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is ſo much barren theory of Divine truths in the World, with ſo little ſerious Chriſtian diligence, doth it not ſadly witneſs how ſmall acquaintance men have with this truth? Whence we ſee ſo great a part of theſe who prefeſſedly acknowledge the word, and are daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44187:17"/> with it, yet can give no other account thereof but report, ſo many that can ſatisfyingly diſcourſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could never put their ſeal to it, that <hi>God is true therein;</hi> whence are ſo many great Schoole divines, and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for parts, ſuch viſible Atheiſts in their way, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? Is it not, they really judge Divinity, and Religion, rather a ſcience, and matter of ſpeculation, then a matter of ſenſe, and feeling, which men should more live then ſpeak, and cannot be knowen without experience the true end of knowledge; but, O. this cannot be found in bookes, men will not meet with it in a throng of choiſeſt notions, it confoundeth the wife, and diſputer of this World, whilſt the meaneſt, and moſt ſimple Chriſtian oft knoweth more, then theſe of greateſt parts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The great Hypocriſy which is in the world, I mean within the viſible Church, doth too clearly shew that this truth is little thought on, or laid to heart; for what is that falſe shew, and appearance (which we may ſay is not a ſin, but the very ſinfulneſs of ſin) is it not the height of Atheiſme? And a real contradiction in their practice to this, that the Scripture of God is true, and will have ane unqueſtionable accomplishment, O could any be ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly irrational, to drive this poor plott how to appear that which they are not, to be at ſuch paines to act the part handſomly of a ſerious Chriſtian, to perſonat his teares, and grief, his ſpiritual frame, his zeal for God, if he did think gravely on this truth, and did beleeve the threatnings of the Word; that they will ſurely take place, and be within a little no complement, but ſad earneſt, and that he is every houre ſtanding under that Scripture-woe againſt Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? I am ſure it would make his very hair ſtand upright, his joynts louſe, and his thighs ſmite upon another, could he but ſeriouſly think upon this.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe unwarrantable wayes which in a time of tryal men take for their eſcape may witneſs this that the Word they do not judge a ſure ground to adventure on; whence is there ſuch heſitation in ſuffering times? From that day ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny taking there leave of Chriſt, who have rather choifed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44187:17"/> ſin then affliction; O is it not? They judge the teſtimony of the God of truth is not ſufficient ſecurity to carry them through ſuch a ſtrait, and are not fully perſwaded that it muſt come to paſſe what he hath promiſed, for if this were, they should reckon it their greateſt ſafety to embarque their intereſt on ſo ſure a ground, and with much quietnes repoſe their ſoul, and disburthen their care by putting it over on the Word.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What doth the frequent diſcouragement and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable walk of the People of God ſpeak forth, doth it not witnes how litle they are in earneſt with this great truth of the Scriptures accomplishment or eſtablisht thereanent? What meaneth theſe diſtruſtful feares, and perplexed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: if their eyes be but open to know, they have ſuch a well as the promiſe of God, at their hand; hovv is it that the ſmalleſt ſtraites are ſo puzling, and ready to out wit them, that they ſo uſually ſtumble at the croſſe? And as things from without doe appear, their eucouragement made to ebb and flow? Is not here the cauſe? That they ſtagger at the promiſe whilſt probabilities in ſome viſible way, doth not go along for its performance: Its truely eaſy to have ſome ſweet notions of faith at a diſtance, but whilſt the tryal comes near, upon ſuch a cloſſe approach, that there is not an other way, but to put the whole ſtreſſe of their particular intereſt, on the Word, and on it alone, many are then at a ſtand, becauſe they are not throughly aſſured that though the earth, should be overturned, there is an abſolut neceſſity for the promiſe of God to take place.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe things may it not appear that this grave truth of the Scriptures accomplishment is but little known, or ſtudyed? I confeſſe we may think on it with aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how a matter ſo nearly concerning is not more our work, there are indeed many things vvorthy to be knopvvn, but our short life can ſcarce allovv time, or give leaſure for the ſtudy thereof, but O this, thongh vve had only 2 dayes to live, I think might require the one, to be ſure, and perſvvaded anent the truth of that vvhereon our heaven,

            <p n="3">3. Hovv can men render to others a reaſon of their hope, vvhen it is enquired, vvho did never ask a reaſon of this at themſelves, or vvill theſe ſeale the truth vvith their blood, who never had it ſealed upon their heart by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rierrce.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wence is it that men can have comfort in Scripture who are not well grounded in the faith thereof? Indeed theſe who are ſolidly perſwaded anent the truth, and its certain outmaking may have much joy and peace, whilſt they know the ground of their confidence can bear up any ſtreſſe or burden they lay upon it, and for what end did the Lord witnes the certainty of his Word by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, wherein its impoſſible for him to lie but that from ſo ſure and ſtrong a ground, his People might have ſtrong conſolation?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44187:18"/>5. How can any think to adventure their immortal ſoul upon that whereon they fear to venture an outward intereſt, or put over their deareſt things in his hand and keeping, who could never ſay, they know in whom they beleeved.</p>
            <p n="6">6. May it not ſeem ſtrange that men can beleeve a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain performance of the Word, and promiſes, and not be more deeply affected therewith? O is this true, shall it ſurely come to paſſe, and not one jot thereof fall to the ground, and should it not cauſe us awake in the night, and bear us more company? Ought we not to think, our ſelves at a loſſe that day wherein, we take not a turn in the meditation of divine truth, if we be ſure that theſe muſt take place?</p>
            <p n="7">7. I would adde, if this be indeed the Scripture of God which ſurely hath an accomplishment. O how are we ſo little Chriſtians? Why doth mens walk, ſo ſadly jarr with ſo great an hope? What manner of perſons should theſe be, that are perſwaded within a little theſe heavens muſt paſſe away as a ſcoll, the elements melt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">V. <hi>The accomplishment of the Scripture is a moſt clear, and undenyable witnes of its Divinity,</hi> that it is his Word who is not like man to ly, or the ſon of man to repent, and hath this as its diſtinguishing character, that not one ſyllable thereof falls to the ground: This is the undoubted privil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of God, and of him alone, to forſee things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent which are many ages after to fall out, and hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon neceſſary, and natural cauſes; and truely, this may be a convincing argument, yea, we may ſay of all external teſtimonies is the greateſt; but its ſtrange to think what a generation there is who can ſport at the Scripture, and queſtion the truth thereof, who yet did never once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enquire if ſuch a thing be true, elſe ſo clear a witne might ſtare them in the face, ſuch a party we should look on with compaſſion, its alſo ſad to think at how poor a rate far below their allowance, many of the Saints doe here live,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44187:19"/> becauſe there is ſo little of that excellent and more noble Spirit, to ſearch the Scripture for their further comfort, and eſtablishment thereby.</p>
            <p>It is true this bleſſed record doth bear witnes to it ſelf, and is knowen by its own light whereon there is ſuch a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible impreſſe of the glorious God, ſuch convincing marks of its true diſcent, as may throughly shew whoſe it is, and how far it exceeds all humane invention, and thus by a clear manifeſtation of the truth, doth commend it ſelf to mens conſciences as a ſafe ground whereon they may repoſe their ſoul: It is alſo clear, how wonderfully the Scripture hath been preſerved, and the original copyes thereof keept through all ages, that what ever ſmall variation there may appear as to ſome <hi>Apiculi,</hi> which in ſome places hath cauſed divers readings, yet, in any neceſſary or ſaving truth the greateſt Criticks will confeſſe they do not in the leaſt vary, and it is knowen (wherein we are to adore that ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God) that the Jewish Church, to whom this ſacred <hi>depoſitum</hi> was delivered, did with ſuch exact and ſingular care look to the ſame, even in the leaſt tittle, or letter thereof; this being the great work and ſtudy of the Mazarites, from one age to another, to ſee to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of that great record, from being in the leaſt vitiat, or corrupt; and the greateſt adverſaries of the truth cannot poſſibly deny that aggreement betwixt theſe many original copyes, in the whole ſubſtance, which may be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to the World. And doth not men ſee, how mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous the whole frame of the Scripture is? What a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency betwixt all the parts thereof, that nothing in it doth in the leaſt, vitiat the proportion, and beauty of the work, but all alongſt an evident tendency to advance holineſſe, and conform the ſoul to God: With a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſent and harmony in anſwering to this great end, we ſee the ſimplicity, and plaines of its ſtyle, yet backt with a convincing Majeſty, and authority upon the conſcience; yea beſids it hath been atteſted by miracles that were great in themſelves, famous in their time, tranſmitted to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44187:19"/> Church in after ages, with unanſwerable evidences of their truth, that not only from the witnes of the Word, but other preſſing, and rational grounds may let us ſee there could be no deceit, or impoſture therein.</p>
            <p>Theſe are a great teſtimony to the truth, but I may ſay, on very ſure ground that, next to that great witnes of the Spirit, there is no argument more convincing to reach A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme a ſtroke and throughly ſatisfy an exerciſed Spirit, who may be plunged anent this great thing, the authority of the Scripture, then a clear diſcovery of its perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whilſt under the aſſault of ſuch a temptation, if this be the very word of God, they may but retire within, and then turn their eyes abroad in the World, to ſee what a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible impreſſe, of the Word is ſtamped on every piece of the work, and providence of God. Now for further clearing I would offer theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt the accomplishment of the Scripture is a very publick teſtimony from Heaven to its divinity, whilſt the Lord by his works through the Earth which are done in the view of Angels and Men doth ſolemnly avow that this is his Word; for we muſt ſay his work within on the hearts of his People, &amp; without about the Church is ſuch, whereat men, yea all the magicians of the earth, may ſtand amazed, and confeſſe that nothing leſſe then a divine almighty power can accomplish the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This gives in the witnes of all the generation of the righteous, who from the beginning have proven the truth thereof, yea ſealed by the blood of many excellent Chriſtians, ſome of whom though they could not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put for it, yet, had ſo ſtrong a demonſtration of the power of the truth within, as made it an eaſy work to dy for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth clearly shew the Scripture is an unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable rule of righteouſnes, that alters not but takes place in all ages, whence ſuch as are wiſe to bring providence in to the Word, and compare the experience, and remarks of one time with another, may have a great reach, and be thus led in a ſure path as to the for ſeeing of events.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44187:20"/>4. This alſo doth demonſtrat that it is his Word who doth rule and guide the World, and hath a ſoveraign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the fame, whilſt we may here ſee ſuch remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able events which both in the preſent, and in former times have fallen out, as may shevv a povver, that can reach the greateſt vvith a ſtroke, shake the moſt eſtablished Kingdomes and even over the belly of inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, accomplish the Word, yea that ſurely the Spirit of the vvheels vvhich moves them is from him vvhoſe Word this is; for it is not more clear that theſe courtaines of the Heavens are ſtretcht forth over the Earrh, then that the Scripture is ſtretcht out over the vvhole vvork and frame of providence, ſo as all the motious, and ſteps thereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the moſt caſual things that fall out hath a viſible ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to accomplish theſe ends vvhich the Scripture hath held forth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This clearly sheweth it muſt be his Word who hath forſeen all things that were to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all the Church, and the various changes and adventures of every Chriſtians life through time, whilſt it is ſo wonderfully shaped, and ſuited to every new tryal of the Church, as if intended only for that time, and to every caſe of a godly man, as though it had been alone writ for them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This alſo sheweth that he who is the author of the Scripture and hath framed that admirable piece muſt have ſome immediat correſpondence with the Spirit of Man, knoweth our ſitting down, and riſeing up, yea doth ſearch the heart, and the reines; for experience can tell how the Word is directed to the heart, doth reach the moſt inward contrivances thereof, doth ſo clearly reveall. and open up a Chriſtian to himſelfe, that we may ſay of a truth, he is the God of the Spirits of all flesh, and one greater then our heart whoſe it is.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I shall further adde, the fulfilling of the Scripture in the experience of the ſaints, doth shew it is not a dead letter, but hath power, and life; and there muſt be an enlightning quickning ſpirit, that ſurely goeth along with the ſame, this clearly demonſtrates ſomething above
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44187:20"/> words, yea above nature in the written. Word, that can make ſuch a change upon the ſoul, give life to the dead, open the eyes of the blind, yea, can turn a lump of earth, that formerly tended downward, now, without any violence to move from a principle of life towards God as the ſparks flee upward.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>The aceomplishment of the Scripture is a moſt pleaſant, and truely delectable ſubject,</hi> worthy of our Serious thoughts, and ſtudy, for here is held out the higheſt truth for the judgement to contemplat, the truth and faithfulnes of God in the Word, and here is alſo the greateſt good for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to embrace, and delight in, as that wherein our whole happines is certainly wrapt up; it is undenyable that it is the godly man, who knoweth beſt what true and ſolide pleaſure is; which he doth not loſſe, by turning his heart from the creature to God, but maketh a bleſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; O, how far doth the joy, and delights of the ſoul exceed theſe of the ſenſes, and the delight of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian how far doth it ſurpaſſe that of a natural man, even in his beſt eſtate; and I am ſure this pretious ſtudy of the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performance of the Word, is one of theſe pathes of pleaſure, which would bring in more ſolide joy to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſome few houres, then ſome years wallowing in the carnal delights of the flesh, which is but as pleaſure in ſport, but quickly turneth to grief in earneſt; it is one of the great miſtakes of the World, that religion tends ſo much to ſadden, and diſquyet the ſoul; nay, it is certainly the want of this, becauſe we are ſo little truely religious, when we ſcruffe over our duety, and take but a paſſing look of the wayes, and work of God in the World, then it is indeed very affrighting, and unpleaſant; but when in a more Chriſtian way, we doe ſeriouſly look thereupon, and get our heart near God, taking the Word alongſt with us, O how delightful, and ravishing a ſight will this be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I truely think though there were not a command, though it were no duety, nor ſuch advantage in the ſtudy of this grave truth, yet that joy, and refreshment which the ſoul
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44187:21"/> would find in ſuch a diligent ſearch, in going down into this bleſſed deep, should invite us thereto.</p>
            <p>But when I ſpeak of this, what a ſweet, and delightful ſubject, the performance and outmaking of the Scripture is, it muſt be underſtood that it is ſo only to the ſaints, and it is no wonder the World keep at ſuch a diſtance with it, for this is a truth they cannot bear, they hate it, which, as Micajah, doth Propheſy alwayes bad things, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a meſſage of death to them; a ſerious look of this truth to ungodly men, is as the hand witing upon the wall before them, which doth foretel their approaching ruin, and should cauſe them all tremble, the knowledge whereof muſt encreaſe their ſorrow, and diſquyetneſs, yea, cauſe them cry out, O, doe not torment us before the time, for they are ſurely undone, and ruined if the Scripture of God be true, and hath a performance; But O what pleaſant, and refreshful tydings, doth this carry to a Chriſtian! What a ſweet view doth he here get of the inheritance, and bleſſed eſtate of the ſaints, which may cauſe ſuch ane excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, how great is that goodnes which is laid up for theſe that fear thee!</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate this, I shall hold out ſomethings, from which we may ſee how delightful a ſubject, the accomplishment of the Scripture is for a Chriſtian to ſtudy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Serious converſe with this grave truth, leadeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to practice, and thus helpeth to bring down theory to experience, which is the moſt ſweet, and deſireable of all other demonſtrations, that we can have of the truth of the Scripture, and maketh our light clear, and pleaſant to the taſte, turning the exerciſe of our judgement, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereanent, into ſenſe, and feeling; we are then made to ſee what a difference there is, betwixt that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which a ſpiritual man (whoſe religion is his practice) hath of this, and the cold winter-light of a natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that hath no heat or warmenes therewith, which is as great a difference as betwixt hearing of ſuch a thing by report, and ſeeing it with our eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44187:21"/>2. This bleſſed ſtudy, hovv the Scripture hath certain accomplishment, vvould help to read the Word vvith an other kinde of pleaſure, O, vvhat repreſentation, should then the truths and promiſes thereof have to the godly man! it vvould be as one going in to look over his charters, and the great things therein contained, vvhich he doth not in the leaſt debat, or queſtion, ſince they are paſt the ſeals, and fully ratifyed, and novv conſidereth all vvhich is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as his own, vvhich he lookt in former times upon, but as a common thing, vvhilſt he made not earneſt of the certainty thereof, and vvhat an intreſt he had in the ſame, O, when he readeth that promiſe of a new heaven and earth, &amp; that glorious eſtate which abideth the Saints! He cannot turn his eyes, &amp; thoughts ſo eaſily off it, but is made to ſtand, &amp; vvonder, that ſo great a thing, that vvill make ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous change in his condition, is even shortly to come to paſſe; hovv ſvveet, and pleaſant is it for ſuch to turn over theſe promiſes, vvho can ſet to his ſeal, and bear this vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he hath as really proven the truth thereof by ſure experience, as he knovveth he hath a real being, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bible is an other thing to theſe, then it is to the great part of men, vvho only make it the ſubject of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this bleſſed ſtudy vve should have much laid to our hand to obſerve, and our obſervation made ſvveet, and pleaſant to us; for there vve might ſee, hovv all the paths of the Lord tovvards his People, are mercy and truth, this vvould give us a refreshful diary of providence, hovv in ſuch a plunging ſtrait we found the Word ſenſibly ſealed; vvhat obſervable confirmations vve have had therevvith, at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a condition, the after-recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vvhich in ane houre of tryal, or in the evening of our life, vvould exceed theſe greateſt pleaſures, the Men of this World can have in looking over their gold, and greateſt treaſures, which for many yeares they have been laying up.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſerious ſtudy of the dayly accomplishing of the Scripture, we should have a moſt ſatisfying vievv, and proſpect of vvhat God is doing up and down the Earth,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44187:22"/> vvhat purpoſes and deſignes he hath on foot, and hovv things here beneath do vvork together for carrying on of the ſame, vve should ſee vvhat an excellent, and curious piece of vvork this frame of providence is, vvhich the more it is conſidered, it vvill be the more a vvonder, hovv per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all its parts, hovv compact, and vvell ſet in all its various collours, what an obſervable concurrence there is there, hovv theſe ſeveral diſcords, vvhich vve ſee here, do yet aggree vvith one conſent, for the compleeting of Gods deſign, vvhich is ſtill going on, and vvhilſt vve think there muſt be ſome diſorder amongſt the vvheells, vve are made after to ſee that this confuſion, vvas an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſtep of providence, confounding the vviſdome of men, every piece of his vvav being ſo knit to another, as diſcovers to ſuch who make this bleſſed truth their ſerious ſtudy, a moſt rare contexture beyond the reach, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the greateſt Artiſts that ever was. Here alſo we might go up to that watch-tower of Chriſtian obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and from thence take a grave look of Gods way, and lay his work in the World to the Scripture, as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring lyne, where we should ſee (and find the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of very pleaſant) how the Word every day takes place, doth ishue through all the veines, and arteries of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, each line whereof is ſo exactly drawen, as by a pincel in ſome skillfull hand, to that great exemplar of the Scripture; here we might diſcern theſe eminent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of judgement, and mercy that in every age are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, how wicked men proſper for a time, yet have a dreadful ishue, and are ſuddenly caſt into deſtruction, they ſpread as a green bay tree, and within a little their place cannot be found, how the godly are oft ſore afflicted, yet flowrishing as the palme tree, and the more they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the more they grow; how the enemies of the Church are oft lifted up for a ſorer fall, and the Church brought low, in order to her greater enlargement; how judgement findeth out ſinners, &amp; is oft exactly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in meaſure, and kinde to the ſin; and on the other hand how integrity is ſore toſſed oft, yet ſtill falleth upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44187:22"/> its feet, &amp; overclouded that it may shine more brightly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; how the threatnings of the Word do viſibly overtake Kingdomes, &amp; nations, bring down great houſes, cauſeth the ſcarlet embrace the dunghil, &amp; letteth not the hoary head of cruel, &amp; wicked men goe oft into the grave in peace, &amp; again to conſider how the Lord forſaketh not his People, but sheweth reſpect to their way, the good man walketh in his integrity, and his ſeed after him is bleſſed O, how ſweet an exerciſe were this for a Chriſtian even to loſſe himſelf in!</p>
            <p n="5">5. From thence we might in a great meaſure diſcern what of the night it is with the Church; if there be any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences that it is neer day; and what ſuch a ſinful caſe doth threaten; we would be skilful to feell the Churches pulſe, and thereby find what ſymptomes there are of life or death, and perceave a dark cloud of judgement caſting up, when it is but like an handbreadth; ſurely this ſtudy should make us wiſe to know the tymes, and what we ought to do therein; for amongſt theſe various events which fall out in every age, the Lords way is conſtant with itſelfe, and vvith his truth, if we be right on lookers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Here we should have a moſt pleaſant and clear view, how the Seripture of God, comprehendeth the whole ſtate of the Church, from the beginning to the end of time; that it is a moſt full, and perfect regiſter of all the viciſſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and alterations, which are to go over her head whilſt in a militant condition; and doth alſo moſt exactly point out theſe occurrences, and remarkable events, which fall out in the ordinary way, and courſe of providence, that we may read them as evidently in the Word, as we ſee them with our eyes fall out in the World; for in following this ſtudy, vve should clearly ſee hovv the Scripture bringeth the Church to light, out of the vvomb of an eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and doth trace it from the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel after the fall throvv theſe dark times before the ſtood, vvhilſt it vvas but in families, and through that long tryal in Egypt, and all its ill journey in the vvildernes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it bring it to its ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44187:23"/> changes of her caſe, under her following decay, and in the times of the captivity, even to the manifeſtation of Chriſt, and dawning of the goſpel; and as it thus taketh in within its reach, the whole eſtate, and the ſpecial events, which did befall the Church under the Law, ſo we may ſee how the Scripture, alſo followeth the Church, through the wholl time of the goſpel, and bringeth her as a grain of muſtard ſeed from a day of ſmall things, until it bring her to perfection, taketh her as it were by the hand from her infancy, and goeth with her through all the turnings of her condition; through that long, and dark night of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts reign, pointeth clearly out her condition, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſaults that shee should endure in that time, and that bleſſed victory which shee should after have, though not all at once, but gradually over her enemyes, and that the Word, and the Church do never part, but one walketh ſtep for ſtep with the other, until it bring her ſafe to land, and as it were put her of its hand, and guard, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This would alſo help us to ſweet thoughts, and give us matter of a ſong in the ſaddeſt night of the Churches condition, when we ſee how Gods great deſign in the World is the accomplishing of the Scripture, and know that his ends which he hath held forth therein, cannot be fruſtrat, it would ſerve to ſilence all our complaints, with wondering at Gods vvay, and triumphing in the vvorks of his hands; vve should not then be affrayd of evill tydings; a ſtormy time vvould not outvvit us; being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvaded that though the earth should be overturned, it shall be ſurely vvell vvith the righteous, the Church muſt flovvrish, and all her enemyes be found lyars, becauſe he is faithful that hath promiſed, vvhoſe Word vvill as ſurely come to paſſe, as the ſun doth return after a dark night.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>It doth now more eſpecially concern the godly in theſe latter times, to ſtudy this great truth of the accomplishment of the Scripture,</hi> and ſet about a ſerious inquiry, and ſearch therein as a truth that shall yet be in a further meaſure diſcovered,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44187:23"/> and opened up, the nearer the Church is to the end of tyme vvhich may thus appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Herein is the Word expreſs, that one piece of the Scripture, vvhich from former ages vvas ſealed up, should in the latter dayes be clear, and eaſy to underſtand, <hi>Dan: lastch. 4: 9. ver.</hi> the ſeal is there put on; but go thy vvay Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel for theſe Words are cloſed, and ſealed to the time of the end, but <hi>Rev. laſt Ch. and ver.</hi> 9. We have that bar taken of, ſeal not the ſayings of the Prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand; becauſe then the time did dravv near, to vvhich a more full diſcovery, and opening up of the Scripture vvas reſerved, &amp; a more large manifeſtation of the ſpirit beyond former ages. Novv by the laſt dayes, vve are not only to underſtand, the vvhole time of the goſpel, though it is thus tearmed in the Scripture, but the latter part of theſe laſt times, vvhich is more eſpecially pointed at, even the cloſe, and evening of time, that laſt Epocha, and period of prophetick chronology, to vvhich a greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44187:24"/> ſay were very dark, O! when that promiſe of the incalling of the Jewes shall once take place, what a wonder will they be to themſelves that their underſtanding shonld have been under ſuch a vail, when the truth shall be clear, and evident to them in that day? Will it not be a ſweet, and eaſy work for the godly to ſort together the predictions of the Word, and the events? And truely there is much now wrapt up in Scripture Prophecyes, not yet fulfilled, which we may ſay, in after times when the event shall unvail their meaning, wil exceed, yea, confound all theſe comments, many have had upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo clear, that theſe Prophecies which of all the Scripture were moſt obſcure, and overclouded with dark figures, and allegories, concerning which there had been ſuch miſtake, and heſitation by the Church, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perplexing queries, have a peculiar reſpect to the laſt times? And that then they shall be made plain, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, vvhen ſo notable a key as the event doth open them up; ſuch as theſe of the vvitneſſes taking lyſe, and riſing again, Babylons fall, and ruine, Chriſts Reigning vvith his Saints a thouſand Yeares, vvhich novv are in ſome meaſure already cleared, from their begun accomplishment, beyond former times, but vve vvait for a more full eommentary, that tyme shall give upon the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is in the latter times that the glory of God in his truth, and faithfulnes, shall moſt eminently shine forth, that is a part of the ſolemn congratulation of the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Babylons fall, <hi>Revelat. 15: ver.</hi> 3. not only <hi>great and marvellous are thy works,</hi> but <hi>just and true are thy wayes,</hi> for truely in this ſtroke of the judgement of God, and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providences concurring therevvith, the fulfilling of the Scripture vvill be ſo plain, and undenyable, that we may ſay, it vvill then dazel the eyes of men, even greateſt Atheiſts, alarme the World, yea, very effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute (we have ground ſo to judge) to that promiſed encreaſe, of the Church, and incoming of the Jewes, when in Antichriſts fall, and ruine, they shall ſee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing a ſeal put to one of the moſt conſiderable Prophecies
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44187:24"/> of the Word, in the accomplishment whereof much of the Prophetick part of the New Teſtament relating to the Churches ſtate, and her long tryal under Antichriſts reign, may be ſeen clearly verified.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord hath reſerved his greatcſt Works to the latter dayes, wherein his judgments shall be manifeſt, and the Word confirmed by ſuch ſolemn convincing providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that men will not get them paſſed without a remark; we are this day witneſſes to many ſuch, and are looking, what theſe times shall yet bring forth, that the great, and remarkable acts of the Lord, muſt force the World to ſee, a divine power, and ſay lo there is an undoubted accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Church in theſe laſt tymes, hath peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagcs, for underſtanding this truth of the Scriptures accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, which former ages had not. Firſt a great part thereof is now fulfilled that men may ſee with their eyes, if they but know how to lay the Word, and work of God together, the Chriſtian Church had in former times, but dark glances at theſe great things; which we have this day viſibly tranſcribed in providence; the promiſes were then travelling in birth of that which is now brought forth. 2. Are we not mounted as it were on the shoulders of that experience and obſervation of former times? which hath been tranſmitted to us, and we muſt ſay upon that account, the Church hath now a greater ſeal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth, then what it had in the dayes of the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, even when Chriſt was in the flesh. 3. The Temple of God and Ark of his Teſtament is now opened in Heaven, light more fully abounding, and the meanes of knowledge; And, O! should not this be much our ſtudy, who have a greater talent then former ages! certainly this will be a ſin of a deeper dye, then in times of ignorance, ſince we can be no ſtrangers to this truth, without shutting our eyes, blinding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doing violence to our light, when the Lord doth give his People ſuch ſolemn confirmations.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44187:25"/>7. I shall add, is it not clearly ſoretold in that <hi>Dan. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ver 4.</hi> that in the laſt times this will be one of the ſpeciall exerciſes of the ſaints to enquire, and make a diligent ſearch concerning the Scripturs accomplishment? For its there ſaid, many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increaſed, importing that this shall be much their ſtudy, and cauſe a diligent fearch, whereunto the great works of God in theſe times shall invite them; and what should be the poſture of the Godly in theſe dayes (on whom the end of the World is come,) should it not be lyke the watchman in the laſt watch of the night, who looketh oft what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there is from the eaſt of the day breaking? a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquery what of the Scripture is fulfilled, whereby we may know on very clear grounds, if the night be far ſpent, the day at hand, and that the coming of the Lord to judgement, draweth near.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>This is a great, and concerning duety for Chriſtians to ſtudy this truth, that they may have ſomething more then repore, how the Scripture hath a ſure accomplishment,</hi> and doth take place in the providences of the time wherein we live. I muſt think ſtrange that there is ſuch a great help as this, ſo near, and yet we ſee it not, nor do ſeriouſly ponder the ſame, when the command is ſo expreſs to obſerve the works of the Lord, which for that end are shewed forth, that men may enquire, and read the faithfulnes of God therein, yea, that ſo great a truth, which would bide the ſearch of all the criticks of the World, a truth wherein our bleſſednes through time and eternity lyeth, should offer it ſelf to our tryall, and yet, is ſo little known; O, who can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with the neglect of this duty? by which we anſwer that ſolemn call, and invitation of the works of God, do honour him, ſerve our generation, are helpers to our own faith, and are thereby helped to ſtrengthen others, yea, are brought to ſee with our eyes, and from experience, what before was as a ſtrange thing unto us.</p>
            <p>Now to clear, how much this is Chriſtians duty, to ſtudy a practical converſe with the Word, and to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44187:25"/> obſervers of its accomplishment, let us conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are thus helped to declare the works of the Lord and to give him the glory of his faithfulneſs; and is not that agrave duty? Which at all times in every ſtation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, should engadge men to this ſtudy; thus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian may become a witnes to the truth, and put his ſeal thereto, for which he should think his life truely deſireable, and he doth in no ſmall meaſure, attain the true end thereof, though he had no other opportunity, for his maſters ſervice, and we may ſay, this truth of the Scriptures accomplishment like a great roll, hath been tranſmitted from hand to hand, from one age, to another, atteſted, and as it were ſubſcrybed by ſo many witneſſes, it doth thus come to our time, and to every mans doore and require their perſonal witneſſing and ſealing of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This should make it an eaſy work, to truſt the Word, and to adventure thereon in the ordinary occurrences of their life, they may well truſt God in ſtrait, who have ſo ſtrong an argument to make uſe of, that oft they have tryed him, and the truth of his Word, by many, many experiences; will not theſe that know his name truſt in him? Which was a notable teſtimony from a ſerious Chriſtian in a very sharp triall; oft have I tryed God, and shall I not learn to truſt him once?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth lay the Chriſtian in the way of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; <hi>Pſal. 107. last. ver.</hi> a promiſe truely large, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, but little conſidered, that <hi>ſuch as are wiſe to obſerve the works of God, they shall ſee the loving kindnes of the Lord,</hi> even in their own particular caſe, made out to them, yea, whilſt they are ſerious to obſerve his works abroad in the World, and his way to others they shall be no loſers, thereby at home, but find this promiſe meet them and to turn their general obſervation unto perſonal experience of the loving kindnes of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus the ſaints by experiencing the truth of the Word get a conyincing ſeal thereby to their intreſt in the promiſe; for begun poſſeſſion, is indeed a ſtrong witnes to this right,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44187:26"/> when they can ſay, they have got as certain returns of the Word, when they have put it to an eſſay, in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of their life, as they are ſure of any thing they did ever ſee, ſo from unqueſtionable experience they ſet up a pillar, and write thereon <hi>Hither to hath the Lord helpt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus should Chriſtians, with much advantage be helped to convince gainſayers; for its ſure, Atheiſme could not make ſo bold, and publick an appearance, if men did not ſo much take their religion on truſt, O, the ſerious experienced man, can with an other confidence own the truth, whoſe experience, and obſervation of the works of God, give him an argument that none can anſwer, while not only he can aſſert, but conduct, and lead men to the things themſelves, that they may ſee if in ſuch, and ſuch particulars, the Scripture be not truely fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus the providenee of God, should have a more ſweet refreshing countenance, when from this great height, that watchtower of Chriſtiau obſervation we take a look thereof, and truely otherwayes, men will ſtumble, at the moſt ordinary diſpenſations, and think Gods Work is a maſſe of confuſion, but here we are taught to ſee, how the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, and his way, are linked in a moſt ſweet ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We may thus trace Divine truth, even by our ſenſe, and feeling, and joyn the Word, and experience in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular correſpondence; yea thus we should have a clear tranſſcript, of the Lords way with his Church taken out of that great authentick original of the Scripture, and there ſee on what a ſolid baſis, and foundation that magnificent ſtructure of providence is raiſed up, what a notable key, should we thus have for opening the Scripture, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humble inquiry, after the works of God? Where not only the impreſſion, and ſignals of the power, but of the truth, and faithfulneſs of the Lord are ſo very le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This is a piece of our talent wherewith we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, of which every Chriſtian should ſtudy a ſerious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44187:26"/> improvement, knowing they muſt render an account, what their obſervation of this great truth hath gained and what furder eſtablishment, and confirmation they have thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I would adde, the concernment, and weight of this duty, may preſſe it much on us; for if the Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment be an undoubted truth, O! then this is ſure the Saints have a great inheritance, they are Princes, though now under a diſguiſe, and though yet minors they are heirs of more then the World can shadow forth; the Chriſtian is then more happy on a dunghil, ſcraping his ſore, then ſuch who are cloathed in purple, and fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately every day; if this be ſure, we should look with compaſſion rather then envy on theſe, whom the World doth account happy, we need not queſtion the gain of Godlines, then it is ſure, that ſuch who ſow in teares shall reap in joy, and the righteous though now trampled under, in the morning shall have dominion; yea, in a vvord, we may then on ſure ground ſolace our ſelves with the thoughts of that great change, which will be within a little, when the grave muſt render back her priſoners, and may with as much aſſurance of a bleſſed reſnrrection ly doun in the duſt, as we are ſure there will be a morning, when we ly down at night. O! then, there is a Heaven, and a hell, that is certain, eternity is not a night dream, and one moment shall shortly put an end to all our ſervices, yea, the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our eye lids at death shall but open them in the Pardiſe of God.</p>
            <p>HAving touched this truth a litle in the general, I shall now, hold forth ſome arguments whence <hi>the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shment of the Scripture</hi> may be demonſtrat; they are theſe five which I intend to proſecute in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44187:27"/>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST Argument,</hi> To prove the Scripture is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fulfilled, and hath an accomplishment is this; that which hath been in all ages, the teſtimony of the Saints, what every particular Chriſtian doth ſeal, from their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ſure experience, what is found, and proved by them, in there dayly walk, upon exacteſt tryal, yea, what as many as ever were ſerious in Religion, do witneſs muſt be certain, and true.</p>
            <p>But the accomplishment of the Scripture is ſuch, Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II. Argument,</hi> That which is manifeſt, and legible in the whole courſe, and tenor of providence about the Church and by clear convincing inſtances, both of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and mercy, is made out to the obſervation of every age, muſt be a certain truth, but the Scriptures <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is ſuch,</p>
            <p>Therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. Argnment,</hi> Thar which hath not only the Chriſtians teſtimony, from experienee, and of the Church from conſtant obſervation, but is obvious even to the view of the World, which from the conſcience of the worſt of men, doth force a teſtimony that they can neither shift, nor deny, which alſo may be demonſtrat to the conviction of ordinary obſervers, &amp; hath a publick acknowledgement, from greateſt Atheiſts, and mockers of Religion in every age, muſt ſurely be a clear truth.</p>
            <p>But, &amp;c, Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. Argument,</hi> That which was to take place in ſuch and ſuch periods of time, and hath accordingly come to paſſe, the event exactly anſwering to the prediction, yea, that whereof the great part is now fulfilled, and but a litle, at this day, remaineth to be made out, muſt be a certain truth.</p>
            <p>But the great part of the Scripture is thus already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44187:27"/> and but a litle thereof now remaineth. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. Argument.</hi> That which not only is for the moſt part already accomplished, but is a thing whereof we have ſuch ſure confirmations, yea, ſo great a pledge in our hand from the Lord, that what yet remaines, shall be certainly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, muſt it not be an undoubted truth? But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as to theſe ſpecial predictions, that are not yet made out, is ſuch as concerning which the Lord hath given his People, a very larg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pledge, and ſtrong confirmations, now in theſe latter times, to believe their certain accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment. Therefore.</p>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <head>ARGUMENT FIRST.</head>
               <p>THat the Scripture of God contained in the Old and New Teſtament, wherein our great hope, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth ly, is certainly true, and hath, a real accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, may be thus demonſtrat, <hi>That it is tryed, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the godly mans experience, to which in all ages, yea, from innumerable proofs the ſaints have put to their ſeal, that this is a ſure, and faithful teſtimory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Experience</hi> is indeed a ſtrong demonſtration, and it is ſuch a witnes as leaveth no room for debate, for here the truth is felt, proven, and acted on the heart, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knoweth well, and is as ſure of as he is perſwaded that he liveth or that the ſun when it shineth hath light, and warmnes therewith, it is true the World liveth at a great diſtance with this, they only converſe with the ſound of ſuch a thing, and we know the naked theory of Scripture truth hath but a short reach &amp; that it differeth as far, from that which a ſerious practicall Chriſtian hath as the ſight of a countrey in a map is from a real diſcovery of the ſame; where the difference is not in the degree, but in the kinde: yet though this grave teſtimony of experience is a thing whereto many (alace, too many) are ſtrangers yet we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44187:28"/> muſt ſay, ſo much thereof is obvious, as may force its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on mens conſciences, and shew that there can be no fallacy, or deluſion in this witnes, if they but allow the uſe, and exerciſe of reaſon, ſeing it is not the record of a few, at one time, or in one corner of the earth, but a ſolemne witnes, from the ſaints, and followers of God, whoſe judgement, and integrity, their adverſaries muſt often confeſſe, yea, of all the ſaints in every age through the whole univerſal Church in parts of the earth moſt remote from other, and this, by moſt frequent renued prooffs, hath found, and experienced the truth, and real accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Word: and now if this be not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, I would but adde, O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>will yow then, come and ſee,</hi> be but Chriſtians indeed, and then ye will no more debate that teſtimony; and truly it is a very poore shift, for men, who have the Scripture before them, which of it ſelf doth witnes its authority, and this backed with ſo ſolemn a ſeal from the Lord, by his works, and providence, to debate the Chriſtians witnes, from their experience, becauſe they do not ſee this themſelves; vvhat is the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? their choiſe, that they do not follovv on to knovv the ſame, the truth of God ſeeketh credit from no man upon truſt, yea, craveth no more but that by a practical converſe they would put it to a trial, and then it shall not decline their judgement.</p>
               <p>Now to proſecute this argument a litle, I shall point at ſome ſpecial Scripture-truths, with which Chriſtians have moſt uſual trade, and converſe in their own caſe; and give in therewith, their teſtimony, how theſe are clearly proved and verifyed by moſt ſure experieuce: it is not to be here underſtood the giving a particular account with reſpect to perſons, time, or other circumſtances, how the Word doth thus take place. I think it may be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to inſtance in the general, ſuch clear uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed experiences, which are well known to the godly, and have by them been oft proved amidſt the various changes of their life (though not by all in the ſame meaſure but in ſome ſuitable proportion to their different ſyzes, tryalls, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44187:28"/> wreſtlings) which can witneſs that real correſpondence which the Word hath with the experience of the ſaints; and truely concerning theſe I may with ſome confidence aſſert, they are not naked, or airy notions, but ſuch as can witnes their truth to the ſerious experienced Chriſtian, whom on this account I dare atteſt.</p>
               <p>I shall here inſtance 5. ſpecial truths of the Word, which are much tryed, and proved in Chriſtians expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. 1. That there is ſuch a contrariety betwixt the flesh, and the ſpirit, as the Scripture holdeth forth. 2. The deceitfulnes of mans heart. 3. That there is a ſpiritual, and inviſible adverſary, with whom we have war. 4. That the promiſes of the Word have undoubted accomplishment. 5. The truth alſo of the threatnings, I mean ſuch under whoſe reach the godly may fall.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>That there is a contrariety betwixt the flesh, and the ſpirit,</hi> a Law in our members rebelling againſt the Law of our mind, is a truth, very clearly proved to the Chriſtian, whoſe experience though ſad doth undenyably verify, and confirm the Scripture, <hi>Gal. 5: v. 17. Rom. 7: v. 19, 21, 23.</hi> this is a piece of the Word which holds forth mans nature in its true shape and form, whither their byaſſe, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation moſt eaſily turneth, yea, ſo marvellouſly anſwereth their experience, that to queſtion the ſame were to put it far beyond queſtion that they know nothing of a new nature or a principle of grace within. For who ever made earneſt of Religion but their firſt acquaintance with the peace of God, was the beginning of this war; it is then that the houſe divideth, and corruption ſetteth up a ſtandard, yea, no ſooner can any begin to be a Chriſtian, but he muſt be a ſouldier alſo; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e may ſay none ever attained ſuch a meaſure of mortification, or was ſo old in the grace of God, as could priviledge them from the ſtirrings of the old man, and neceſſity of that complaint, who shall deliver us from a body of death, but what ever advantage, ſome of the ſaints have above others, yet in this their experience can witnes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44187:29"/>1. They now know two different parties within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that until once grace came they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, which at the ſame time in the ſame action do act oppoſitly one to the other, yea, that there is no ſpiritual duty, wherein the flesh (though not alwayes in ſuch a prevalent degree,) doth not shew ſome active reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the ſtirrings, and motions of the flesh have ſtill a tendency, congruous to their own nature, to turn the heart carnal and to alienat it from God, ſo as it is eaſy to diſcern how in theſe, the riſe and the end do throughly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is a cruel taskmaſter if once it bear ſway; imperious in its command, and violent in its purſuit, ſo that their experience may herein tell, its a ſore, and an intolerable thing for a ſervant to bear rule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That to things moſt forbidden the flesh moveth moſt impetuouſly, ſo, as it will even break through the hedge, though ſure there by to be ſcratcht wirh thornes, yea, it is oft ſo eager in its purſuit, that it will follow the bait, while the hook is moſt diſcernable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That when once this doth ſwell, and wax fat, they may upon another intereſt cry, <hi>woe's us, our leannes,</hi> for like the ſcales of the ballance, they find a proportionable abatement and depreſſing of their ſpiritual life, as the flesh goeth up, yea, they have cauſe to know how every ſtep of their hearts going forth to the World is a ſtep that doth put them further off from God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That the more cloſely the Law is preſt in its ſpiritual extent, yea, the more ſpiritual a duty is, the more fully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit they find their carnal heart, and though the flesh may bear up a litle with the forme of Religion, and hath more complacency with that way, which lyeth moſt in externals, yet it cannot endure the power thereof, it can ſuffer men to be Hypocrites, but not truely Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To reſtrain, and bring this under bondage they find that it doth put the Spirit ſo much at liberty, which getting looſe rains for a litle will leave the ſoul work for many

               <p n="8">8 That indulgence to the flesh cauſeth a ſenſible thick interpoſition between Heaven, and the ſoul, whence they are ſo clogged, and hamperd in their flight, and motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, yea, thus have often, their choiſed duties been made a ſore, and grievous task.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That this is the true riſe of their uſual perturbations, and doth ſtill put ſome jar betwixt them, and their lot, and doth hinder a ſatisfyed enjoying of that which they have, through murmuring at that they want, yea, they know, that to pleaſe the flesh hath been oft the cauſe of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grief, and diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p n="10">10 They alſo find how the defilement of their Spirit, doth help to darken it, which overgrown with the flesh, can have no clear diſcovery of ſpiritual things, but the more ſeparat from the body, and purged from theſe groſſe dregs, they find themſelves at a further advantage to converſe with divine truths. which thus they get diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beyond all that nature can reach.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>That the heart of man is deceitful, and deſperatly evil,</hi> Jer. 17: <hi>ver. 9.</hi> Jer. 4: <hi>ver. 14.</hi> Prov. 4: <hi>ver. 23. is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truth, where to the Chriſtians experience</hi> doth anſwer, as the face anſwereth to its ſelfe in the glaſſe, yea we may ſay it is ſo clearly demonſtrat to theſe who were ever ſerious, about their inward caſe, that while they thus read the Word in themſelves and are made to read themſelves in the Word they may with wonder acknowledge, that he, which can ſound this great deep of the heart, and drawe ſo vive a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture thereof, is ſurely one before whom all things are manifeſt; who doth ſearch, and try the reins, and know what is our mould, and fashion; this is one of the very firſt leſſons which practical Religion doth teach, and the more nearnes with God, and further meaſure and grace, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44187:30"/> is attaind, the more clear diſcovery there will be of this; O! what ſad houres, what bitter complaints, hath it cauſed? This oft doth marre the Chriſtians feaſt, and mingle their Wine with Gall, and wormwood; I am ſure if that excellent company of the Saints, who have been from the beginning to this day could be brought together, ro give in their ſuffrage, and witnes concerning the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the heart, there would be one joynt teſtimony to this truth, we should find that Enoch who walkt with God, Moſes with whom he ſpake face to face, that beloved ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who leand in Chriſts boſome, and he vvho vvas caught up to the third Heavens vvere no ſtrangers thereto, but could vvitnes thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is vvithin, vvhich aileth them moſt, and their greateſt adverſaries are men of their ovvn houſe, yea, that in the vvorſt of times, there is ſtill more cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of an evil heart, then of an evil, and corrupt World, there being no vvorſe company, then they are oft to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no time of their life, but might give them, ſome further proof, that they are fooles vvho truſt their ovvn heart, vvhich oft vvill eſcape and over-reach, their quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reflexion, even vvhen both their eyes are on it; yea, that there is no time that allovveth the putting off their armour, or to diſmiſſe their guard, not the beſt caſe of the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablishment in grace, nor the evening of the day, though they vvere vvithin ſome minutes of the crovvn, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory doth priviledge them from the experience of a deceitful heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That under the beſt frame they find there will often lurk that which after-time, doth diſcover that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent though it had been told, they could not have believed untill frequent experience maketh them ſee that the Word knowed their heart better then themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That to bring home their heart when once it goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or recal the liberty they have given it is not eaſy, which doth no ſooner parley with a temptation at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44187:30"/> adventure to ſport therewith, but it quickly turneth to earneſt, and is ready to yeeld.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They know the conſtant need to have a watch upon their ſenſes, and to make a Covenant with their eyes, which doe ſo quickly betray their heart; ſo eaſy it is to be deceived, yea, to grow warm, and to take need-fire upon the ſmalleſt touch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How quickly alſo their ſpirit doth ſlacken, and loſe its benſil even in the greateſt advantage of their caſe their experience can tell, that when in ſome meaſure they have been raiſed up in any ſpiritual enjoyment, they were then in hazard to be lift up to the wind, and to have their ſubſtance diſſolved in the more ſolid part of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What a ſight have they ſometime of themſelves, ſuch as would be a terrour, to them if the heart, and motions thereof could be writ out to the view of others, or that any were vvitneſſes to that which in one roome will dwell beſide the grace of God as its door-neighbour.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In a word their experience doth witnes, how ſoon the ſtrongeſt reſolutions will evanish, that they are not oft in the evening, what they were in the morning, nor for many houres do they keep the ground they had attaind, but Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens Character unſtable as water, may be ſtil their complaint, yea, I am ſure as many as ever obtaind mercy, to know themſelves, can tell that its paſt all reckoning, how oft their heart hath deceived them, when they truſted it moſt: This every day may cauſe them ſit down, and admire the grace of God, which can mend, what they ſo oft marre, and is ſtronger to ſave, and preſerve, then they are to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>III. That as there is a body of death within, they alſo know there is, <hi>An adverſary without, Eph. 6: v. 12. 1 Pet. 5: ver. 8. Ioh. 8: v. 44.</hi> whoſe way, and devices, and method of tempting doth moſt exactly anſwer the diſcovery of the Word, this is indeed a truth, which Chriſtian experience in all ages doth witnes, that no ſooner they had a ſerious look after God, but found themſelves, purſued by an inviſible
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44187:31"/> party whoſe approaches though ſpiritual, are yet certain, and moſt ſenſibly demonſtrated, beſide that which the Word doth clearly teach, yea, it is ſure none of the ſaints were ever priviledged from ſuch experiences, for herein doth the Chriſtans warfare ly, but O how ſweet may the evening be while they ſit down, can ſing that ſong, <hi>Our ſoull hath eſcaped as a bird from the fowller.</hi> I shall heer give in ſomething of the godly mans experience, which can bear witneſs to this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is ſurely an other party then the World, or themſelves, with which they have to doe, an inviſible adverſary without, whom they perceive by that ſenſible correſpondence he keepeth with their heart within, by theſe violent inroads, importunat ſoliſtations, theſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motions, wherewith they are ſo ſtrangely hurried, and oft driven over light, and judgement, yea, over their ſtrongeſt reſolutions, ſo as he may be as diſcernable to them, and that there is ſomething therein beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they converſed with him in an outward viſible shape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſince the time when they begun to look after God, and to know any thing of his work upon their ſpirits they have been acquainted with moſt affrighting, dreadful temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and doth now preceive his rage, and violent purſuit to bring them back, which they knew not before, when at peace with their idolls, and ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the mark he levelleth at, to which his uſual temptations have a tendency, is their ſoul, and inward man to hinder communion with God, and to turn their heart off from him, to break the Law, and lay a ſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That his ordinary approaches to the heart are oft by a very ſmall thing, he needs no more but an open door, or a ſinful look for the diſpatch of a temptation, and knoweth by a wound in the eye, how to carry death in, to the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he is ſuch a party as knoweth his time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, can change his weapous, and busk the book
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44187:31"/> with divers baites and yet he is allvvayes at hand, vvhen the heart is lifted up, vvhen they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. That his vvay doth truely anſvver his name, <hi>Spiritual wickedneſſe in high places,</hi> this being ſo diſcerned, by daily experience that he hath the advantage of the ground, is a moſt ſubtile obſerving adverſary, vvho lyeth in the dark to us, vvhile we are in the light to him, and knopweth how to correſpond with our corruption, and to ſuit his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our natural temper (wherewith he is well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and to our calling, and our company, to the preſent ſtrait, to our predominant inclination and to our retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſolitude, yea that he is one who knoweth how to follow in, and ply with ſuch a gale, when we are in hot blood, or in any diſtemper, and diſcompoſure of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That he can tranſform himſelf into an Angel of light, and ſute his temptations to the ſpiritual exerciſes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the ſaints, that there are temptations on the right hand as well as the left, which are ſo refined, and ſo like a Chriſtian exerciſe, that they can ſcarcely diſcern the weed from the flower, and moſt dreadful errours from the choiſeſt truths, to which they oft have a great reſomblance, though at laſt it doth appear that the native tendency even of the moſt ſpecious errours in the judgement is to looſnes in practice, and to make men religiouſly irreligious.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That he is alſo a roaring lyon, which they have oft proved by the dreadful blaſphemous injections, theſe fiery darts which are thrown in with violence, wherewith there is no concurrence of the inclination or conſent, but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable force put upon them, aſſaulting them with moſt horrid Atheiſtical thoughts, even while their heart doth riſe with abhorrence, and enter their diſſent againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That he is a moſt reſtleſſe adverſary, who is going ſtill about and giveth uo ceſſation, but with purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at ſome greater advantage; and is no leſſe terrible in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44187:32"/> his flight then in his aſſault &amp; that he can ſpeak out of a friend as well as out of a foe, yea, and doth then moſt dangerouſly tempt, when the temptation is leſt ſeen, or diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That his temptations doe not only drive at engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart to bring ſin to the thought, but alſo the bringing it forth to the act, for putting ſome blot upon their walk, and converſation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That he is one who is overcome by reſiſtance, and doth flee before theſe that withſtand him, which they have oft proved, that they have returned from prayer with the ſpoyl of their adverſary, and at ſuch a time have been made to wonder, how that which hath oft foyled them, should have been their temptation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They alſo find by frequent obſervation that though he is moſt ſubtile, being indeed one who through long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and continued practice hath attained a great deal of dexterity in tempting, yet, that he hath one uſual method, and devices which the ſerious Chriſtian, by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, and watchfulnes may eaſily diſcern and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his temptations in their riſe, and at a diſtance while they are as it were, creeping up the wall; yea, thus in ſome meaſure he may find out the depths of Satan, and know how to avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the net ſpred by that great fouler.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>That the promiſes of the Word which are held forth to the Godly</hi> for their uſe, and encouragement while they are in the way, <hi>have a certain accomplishment,</hi> and are a ſafe ground to adventure upon, and worthy to be credited, is a truth tryed in all ages wherto experience of the ſaints can give a large teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Now in ſpeaking to this grave ſubject, it is not needful to ſpeak any thing of the nature, and diverſe kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes nor whence it is that we live at ſo poor a rate, and ſo unconfortably while ſuch a well as this, is at our hand, for its eaſy to read the cauſe within our ſelves, we ſow ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and venture little out, therefore we have ſo ſmall an increaſe; their is a price for wiſdome, but it is in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44187:32"/> hands of fools who have no heart thereto, but this not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us here I only aime to hold out this, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which God hath given his People in the Scripture, are of unqueſtionable verity, and have as real, and ſure performance in the ſaints experience, as they are ſure of that which cometh moſt neceſſarly to paſſe, by the worke and concurrence of natural cauſes as that the fire doth burn, when combuſtible matter is added, or the ſun riſe after its going down; for indeed this truth is ſo manifeſt, proved by ſuch innumerable experiments, amidſt the various changes of a Chriſtians condition, that we might ſommond as many witneſſes as have been followers of God in the World, which are not a few, who in all ages have put the promiſes to an eſſay, and put their ſeal thereto that God is true; yea, to ask at ſuch, if they know whither there be a truth in Scripture promiſes, that cometh not to paſſe, I think were to enquire at a living man, whither he ſeeth, and feeleth, or if there be ſuch a thing as motion, ſince they have as ſure, and ſenſible a demonſtration of the one, as he hath of the other.</p>
               <p>But ere I ſpeak any thing particularly to this, I would firſt premit ſome things to clear what we underſtand here, by the ſaints experience of the truth of the promiſes, in theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We would conſider, though the Scripture hath here it's accomplishment, and is intended for the uſe of the Church, and every particular Chriſtian, while on the way in his militant condition yet there are ſome promiſes of the Word yea, the greateſt, which belong to the ſaints, that will not be fulfilled, until they have caſt off their armour, and are called to divide the ſpoyl, their experience of which, will be the high prize of the calling of God in Chriſt, whereof all which they now enjoy is but an earneſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would conſider that the great intent of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and promiſes thereof, is not for contemplation, but that we may know them by experience, and drive a bleſſed trade, and commerce therewith, the merchandize of which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44187:33"/> is better nor that of gold, for herelyeth the Chriſtians life in the World, yea, it is a great part of their talent, the promiſes, which are not to be laid up in their heart, and memory, as in a napki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but they muſt give an account, what experience they have gained thereby, and thus the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand should make rich.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ever be the different ſyzes, and degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience among the ſaints, according to their grouth, and age in Chriſt, yet it is certain that the meaneſt who have intreſt in the promiſes, and did ever grip them in earneſt and put them to tryal muſt know ſomething of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſamein their own caſe; for the Lord doth not ſuffer his work in his People to want a ſeal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The godlyes experience hereof, is then much made out, when they are much in obſervation, and we know little of the truth, and performance of the promiſes, becauſe we are not more habitually in a frame to obſerve; thus he goeth by, and we perceive not; but they never wanted confirmations, who were ſeriouſly ſeeking to be confirmed in the truth of the Word.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſpecial mercyes, and providences of a Chriſtian lyfe, are a certain return of the promiſe, and in that way do meet them, as the proper channel of their conveyance; for they are the ſure mercies of the Covenant, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshful is it that all the ſeveral caſes of the Saints, and their outgate theteof, their meaneſt as well as their greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, are comprehended in the Word. and under ſome promiſe, and were all forſeen in his everlaſting view, who hath ſo marvellouſly ſuited the ſame to all that his People ſtand in need of, as if it had been directed to ſuch, and ſuch a Chriſtian only.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This helpeth to make the mercies of the godly man to have a peculiar, and ſweet relish, and to be ſomeway twice his mercy, when he gets them in ſo immediat a way reached to him as it were out of the hand of the promiſe, and as an obſervable return from Heaven, when thus the Lord ſealeth his Word to him by his work, &amp; the way of the Word, he findeth hath been the way of his comfortable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44187:33"/> outgate; that when he hath had no other eſcape, but to tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n in to the promiſe, and to caſt himſelf upon it, he gained this experience; he truſted in God, and was help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and can give in this teſtimony of him, that he hath both ſpoken it, and himſelf alſo hath done it, according to his Word.</p>
               <p n="7">7 It is not any extraordinary thing, we here underſtand, by the Chriſtian mans experience of the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it is not a rapture or revelation, or ſuch as ſome of the Saints hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon ſome ſingular, and ſpecial account had; for we have not any promiſe for theſe things, but it is ſomething, well grounded upon the Word which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly holdeth in the Lords ordinary way of procedure with his People, according to the tenor of the Covenant, for his Word doth good to them that walk uprightly, and doth certainly take place in the experience of every ſerious, and diligent Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is not the teſtimony of a few, but the record of all the Saints ſince the beginning, whoſe experience doth all moſt harmoniouſly agree, and bear one witnes that he is faithful who hath promiſed, and it is not that which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath found once, or twice in his life, but the dayly food of ſuch as live by faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This doth put a ſtrong obligation on the godly man to the Word, for the time to come, for theſe who have tryed it often, may with much confidence truſt it, in the day of their ſtrait.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The experience which the godly hath of the real performance of the promiſes is a moſt convincing evidence of his ſtate in Chriſt, it is the earneſt, and pledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and full accomplishment of that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Lord will make perfect what concerneth him, who hath been his help hitherto, and will be his exceeding great reward in the end who hath made him find ſo much of the gain of godlines, here by the way.</p>
               <p>Now having premitted theſe things, I shall here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſome particular promiſes, where in the Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s moſt uſual trade; and commerce dothly, and to which they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44187:34"/> give in their ſeal and witnes; I confeſſe if all theſe proofs which the Saints have had, of the fulfilling of the promiſes could be gathered together, we might make uſe of that Divine hyperbole, <hi>The World could not containe the bookes that should be written thereof.</hi> O, what an admirable volume, what an excellent commentary, and copy should this be of the Scripture, to ſee it thus turned over into the experience of every Chriſtian; it would be ſome way as eaſy to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the drops of rain, and dew ſince the creation, as to reckon, all theſe pretious drops, and emanations of love, theſe ſenſible returns, and outmakings of the promiſe, which they have had in their experience; I truely think it could hardly be believed, though it were told, what ſome of the godly, here, have found in the way of the Word; but it is ſufficient, to anſwer the deſign of this work, to shew that there is a ſenſible demonſtration, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Scripture promiſes, concerning which the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Saints in all ages doth aggree; that by many confirmations the Lord hath oft ſealed the truth thereof to their ſoules.</p>
               <p>There are 10. ſpecial promiſes, held forth to the godly in the Word, which I shall here inſtance, and therewith hold forth, what a clear teſtimony their experience can give, of the undoubted truth, and aecomplishment of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST. Inſtance, is that promiſe given to believing,</hi> to ſuch who credit the naked word, when there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable appearance of its outmaking, and thus give God the glory of his faithfulnes, which we have expreſly held out. <hi>1 Chron. 20: 20. Pſ. 112. 7, 8. Ich. 1: 50.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To clear the accomplishment of this promiſe, I shall; but appeal to that teſtimony the ſaints in all ages have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> thereof, yea to the preſent experience of the godly at this day, if they have not certainly found it ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when in a particular they have truſted God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and got their ſpirit quiet in a recumbency on him if he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44187:34"/> hath not dealt with them according to his word, yea if then from cleer convincing returns of the promiſe they have not been made to ſay it did never repent them, that they gave more credit to the teſtimony of God, then of their own hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have found a more ſweet, and obſervable iſſue, then, when their help lay moſt immediatly on the word alone; never a more ſenſible outgate then when leaſt of ſenſe, and moſt of faith was in carrying them through, when little of the creature, and much of God appeared in their mercy, and where they were at the loweſt, no way of eſcape but to throw themſelves on the promiſe; they have then had the beſt retreat, yea, their ſupply as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly felt, as their need, and burden had formerly been felt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That their greateſt difficulties, and shakings anent the promiſe have helped to their further confirming, and eſtablishment, and ſo as they can ſay, the Lords way, by brangling them firſt, yea, to their ſenſe looſing their grip, hath helped to faſten it better, and that which for the time, did ſpeak their caſe moſt helpeleſſe, hath made way for his more eminent appearance, and manifeſting of him ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That their greateſt venture, and giving moſt out hath uſually had the richeſt income, the moſt eminent experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their life, have followed the moſt adventurous acts of their faith, yea, upon an after reckoning they have oft found, that their adventuring of life, eſtate, and credit on the promiſe of God, even in theſe things, hath very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervably been their upmaking.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That where they have moſt been a friend to their faith, there hath faith alſo been moſt a friend to them, in their ſtanding to the credit of the promiſe, over the belly of greateſt objections, and falſe reports raiſed thereof, they have found a very evident mark of Gods reſpect to the ſame, cauſing them to ſee, that he will honour ſuch who thus honour him. And it is indeed worthy of a remark, what we have of Caleb upon record, that he took part with the

               <p n="6">6. That believing, doth alwayes make way for ſenſe, and in their cloſing with the naked Word of promiſe, they have not wanted the ſeal of the ſpirit of promiſe, but have found a ſweet calm, their burden ſenſibly eaſed, when once they got it laid over on the word, which they can ſay hath been their firſt reſting place, like the very fixing of the motion of the needle, towards its right point, when their ſpirit had been reſtleſſe, and in greateſt agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That theſe greateſt diſappointments, which their hope in the Word, ſeemed to have, they have found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards moſt to their advantage, when their returns have not only been according to their faith, but have often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their adventure, and been far beyond what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, yea, that from frequent experience they may ſay, the iſſue of truſting the Word, how long ſo ever they thought it deferred, yet, came alwayes in ſeaſon, was never too late and out of time.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That this did never occaſion bitter reflexions, or was their upcaſt before the World, that they truſted God in a day of ſtrait and were not helped; but this teſtimony have all ſuch left, who have moſt credited it in a diſmall houre, that none should ſcarr, after them to hazard upon ſuch a hand, and venture on the promiſe, for, their faith hath oft taken them well, and comfortably through, where both ſenſe, and reaſon have been ready to ſink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND. Inſtance,</hi> Whereby we may ſee the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the promiſe in Chriſtian experience is this <hi>that God truely heareth prayer,</hi> is near unto his People in what they call upon him, aggreable to his Word, and will anſwer their deſires, we have this promiſe moſt expreſſe, <hi>Phil. 4: ver. 6.

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44187:35"/>
               <p>Now the accomplishing of this piece of Scripture is ſo very clear, that I can atteſt the experience of all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous, ſince the beginning, what frequent &amp; unanſwerable comfirmations, they have got of this truth in their Chriſtian walk, fo that I am ſure, no man ever was in earneſt in the matter of Religion, and a ſtranger to this; yea. that he was never more certainly perſwaded of any thing, then of this that God doth hear prayer. O if mens ſouls were but in their ſouls ſtead whoſe evening wreſtlings, and teares, the Lord hath oft turned into a morning ſong, they should know this is no deluſion, I shall here touch ſomething of that experience which by many proofs the ſaints can give as a witneſs to this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when they have oft with <hi>Hanna</hi> gone in before the Lord in the bitternes of their ſpirit, they have been made to return with a ſenſible, and marvellous change in their caſe; yea, when in going about prayer, they have been put to wreſtle with much diſtemper, and deadnes, they have oft ſeen the wind diſcernably change, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their ſpirits lightned from under that burden, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable calme, and ſerenity after much invvard perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea they can ſay that they have found their hearts thavved, and put in a flush of tendernes, upon the back of a moſt ſenſible reſtraint.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That acceſſe, and liberty to poure forth their ſouls to God vvhen he hath filled their mouth vvith arguments, and inabled them both to wreſtle, and vviat, they have found a favourable <hi>Criſis</hi> and begun outgate, yea, the very turn of a ſad caſe, vvhich they have got from the Lord, as the pledge of a further anſvver, and that vvhen he thus prepareth the heart, he doth cauſe his ear to hear.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That vvhen they have been under a moſt dark cloud, they have found their sky clear, have got a very ſenſible taſte of Gods acceptation in prayer and of his taking their ſute off their hand, even vvhile the matter vvas ſtill in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence before him, yea that they have oft had ſuch a ſatiſfying impreſſion impreſſion of Gods minde, and perſvvaſion of his anſvvering their deſire, as hath helped them cheerfully
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44187:36"/> to vvait, yea ſometimes to ſing the triumph before the victory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That vvhen they had been much in prayer, they muſt alſo ſay, it hath been the time vvherein the ſpirit hath flovvrished, vvas moſt lively, yea that then they had their beſt dayes that then, the candle of the Lord shined upon their pathes, and his devv lay all night upon their branches and that they have found there is an evident, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable abatement of their ſpiritual life, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in God, according to their vvearing out in the exerciſe of this duety.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have many times found, that vvhen there vvas nothing left them, but to turn in to God, and they knevv of no other vvay to come through but to pray, and look up, they. never found a more ſvveet, and ſeaſonable outgate; ſo that moſt obſervable times of prayer, have been alſo the moſt obſervable times of their experience, and they can ſay from many proofs. it is no hopeleſſe buſſines, vvhich is put over upon God by prayer, though there be ſmall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard appearance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That it is not in vain to follow out a ſute before the throne, and that acceſſe and moyen in Heaven, is as ſure a way to come ſpeed (which they know well) as greateſt moyen upon earth; having ſo evidently found, while many ſeek the rulers favour, that the determination of every thing is from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That prayer with quiet onwaiting in the uſe of meanes wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>neth comfortably through, where over caring, and carnal policy, in the uſe of all other shifts hath been forced to ſtick.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They know by experience that as there are judicial times, wherein, an inhibition as it were is laid on them from the Lord, in their wreſtling, yea and a ſore reſtraint on their ſpirits, which hath been very ſenſible, ſo alſo they have found times of more eaſy acceſſe, and abundant liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ſpirit of prayer, let forth, before ſome ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and deliverance to the Church, whereby they could in ſome meaſure diſcern its neer approach.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:44187:36"/>9. That on the back of ſome ſolemn addreſſe, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God by prayer, and faſting in a day of ſtrait, they have oft ſeen cauſe even from that day, and up ward to date a remarkable return, and outgate, in which even common obſervers, might diſcern what an evident anſwer, the Churches interceſſion with God in times of extremity hath had.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I may adde the ſaints know this ſo well by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that ſurely God heareth prayer, even in ſuch, and ſuch a particular, that they can with much confidence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and make an earant of the meaneſt, as well as their greateſt concernments to him, having ſo oft tryed, and found that ſeriouſnes, and ſincerity in addreſſe to God, was never in vain, but what ever be the times wherein this promiſe taketh place, their heart shall live that ſeek God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRD. Inſtance Is the promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> and powring out of the ſame, which we have clear in the Word, <hi>Iſ. 59: v. 21. Ioh. 14: 16, Luk. 24: v. 49. Rom. 8: 16, 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accomplishment of which is ſo manifeſt, ſuch a ſenſible demonſtration thereof, in the experience of the ſaints that I am ſure this can no more be denyed, then theſe who are warmed with the heat of the ſun can deny their ſenſe, and feeling, that the ſun hath ſuch an influence: and doth not the Chriſtans ſpiritual walk, bear as convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a witnes to the fulfilling of this promiſe, as any living man, by walking in the way sheweth that he hath a ſoul, and principle of life within him. Novv to demonſtrat this a litle I vvould but touch ſome of the ordinary experiences of the ſaints therein, vvhich they doe teſtify and by clear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable evidences knovv to be no deluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1. That to truſt God with their caſe, and give him the guiding of their way, hath taken them much more eaſily through a plunging caſe, them overcareing anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, the Lords directing their ſteps, and making things ſucceſsful, when they have committed the ſame to him, hath been often as ſenſible to them, as their ſtrait, and difficulty was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the way of the word hath been the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for taking them ſafe, and comfortably through,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44187:38"/> &amp; that they never repented that they did more conſult their duty, then inclination, when they were at a ſtand about a particular, and did not debate the command, even while there ſeemed a lyon in the way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they were never left without counſel, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when their eye was ſingle, and ſerious about it, and it was not ſo much want of light as of an heart to cloſe therewith, that made their way oft ſo dark, but when they ſubjected themſelves to Gods minde, they found, that ſuch who follow him, shall not walk in darknes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That light, and counſel doth tryſt men in following the command, and the practice of known duety, hath help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to know more the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. They alſo know, that Gods following in light, with a powerful impreſſion, his teaching the reines, and inſtructing with a ſtrong hand, is no deluſion, but the ſure, and well grounded experience of moſt ſolid Chriſtians in all ages, yea, moſt diſcernable from any falſe impulſe, and that ſome ſpecial piece of work and ſervice, which God hath layed in their way, wants not uſually ſome ſpecial call, backed wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now that there is a real accomplishment of this, I am ſure the experience of the ſaints can in all ages clearly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: what joy and peace this hath occaſioned, what a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible demonſtration, and ſolemn confirmations they have had of this promiſe, ſo as their very bones might ſing, <hi>Who is like unto the, o Lord!</hi> It is true real pardon of ſin, doth not allwayes inferre the ſenſible feeling thereof, and when it is remitted in Heaven, there is not alwayes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it in the conſcience, but it is alſo ſure, that this is ſenſibly felt and that it is tryed by all even all the generation of the righteous to have had as powerful an operation on a diſquiet, troubled ſoul, as ever wine, or the choiſeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial could have on the ſick, or faint; O! if theſe who queſtion this, were in their caſe, to whom God ſpeaketh peace after a ſtorm, they should know how real, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that is, I would offer the Chriſtians witnes to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, from many, many experiments, by vvhich the Lord hath ſealed it to their ſoul, whereby they know aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly it is no fancy, or deluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How this hath as ſenſible a connexion with the ſerious exerciſe of contrition, and repentance in their experience, as it certainly hath in the word, and promiſe; while they find, that in ſilence, and keeping up their caſe from God,

               <p n="3">3. It is no deluſion which they can command no more, then the ſun to shine when overclouded, or the wind to blow, but when it liſteth, which the moſt perſwading mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arguments, can no wayes effectuat nor all their former experience, yea, the letter of moſt refreshing promiſes, which ſometimes are to them, but as the white of an egge, without taſte, until once the ſpirit breath, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diſcovereth the ground of their joy in the word, but doth alſo cauſe them to rejoyce therein, when it shineth upon the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be no deluſion which cauſeth ſo marvellous a change that after greateſt diſquieting fears, they have found moſt ſenſible manifeſtations of love, the greateſt flood on the back of the loweſt ebb in their ſpiritual condition, which oft hath forced them to retreat, what their feares, and jealouſies did utter; yea, have made them enquire with wonder, whence they are ſo chearful to day, who yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night were ſo broken, and crusht; whence their ſpirit, should be in ſo ſweet a calm, that ſo lately was like the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and troubled ſea.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That this hath oft met them, as a bleſt ſurprizal, and unexpected welcom, when they have in a backſliding caſe come in to God, they certainly know, that when they knew not how to adventure, and at what end of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled condition to begin, counts having run long over, yet, on their very firſt addreſſe, have got a ſweet diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44187:40"/> to their feares, been helped to their feet, yea, ſome times have had as it were the fatted calfe killed to make merry with their friends.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That which hath an audible voice within, ſo ſtrong an Impreſſion upon the ſoul, which carryeth with it ſuch a clear ſatisfying diſcovery of Gods heart, and love, is ſurely no deluſion, while the intimation of that one truth, <hi>Your ſins are forgiven,</hi> or any other word of promiſe for that end, they have found to be an argument beyond words, which they could not reſiſt, but for the time, have been as ſure, they ſee, and feel this, as that they live, yea, can no more now call it in queſtion, then formerly they could get it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That is no deluſion which cauſeth them with another kinde of freedome, approach to God, maketh them know there is a Spirit of adoption which ſets the ſoul at liberty, from the ſore bondage, and thraldome under which their former backſliding had put them, yea, a thing not only ſenſibly felt by themſelves, but may be diſcerned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, while they cannot ſmoother the joy of their heart or hide in their couutenance ſuch a change of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that truely God hath dealt comfortably with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hath not this the Saints in all ages witneſſed even a joy unſpeakable, and full of glory, which though but of short continuance yet for the preſent ſo ſtrong, as hath ravished their ſoul with the hope of the inheritance above, and clear view of their intereſt in it, yea, ſometimes, made them ſing for joy, in expectation of that bleſſed day but, O! this is better felt then expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And in a word can that be a deluſion that hath oft turned the poor mans hell into a Heaven, which tryſts the Chriſtian in the way of his duty, and the work doth ſo exactly anſwer the promiſe, moſt ſenſibly felt after greateſt shakings of the conſcience by the law, and can make a ſad outward lot, ſo very ſweet, and pleaſant, cauſe them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the wrath of men, to ſing in a dungeon, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and have all things under greateſt wants, look grim
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44187:40"/> death chearfully in the face in its moſt dreadful aſpect, yea, doth make ſo great, and viſible a difference betwixt the Chriſtian, and himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIXTH Instance, Is that promiſe of encouragement, and ſupport under the croſſe,</hi> which is expreſly held forth in the Word, that the Lord will own his People, bear their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and be with them in trouble in the day of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his truth; yea, will bind up the broken in heart, &amp; heal their wounds. <hi>Pſal. 91: ver. 15. Iſai. 43: ver. 2. Cap. 41: ver. 17. &amp; Cap. 49: ver. 14. Pſal. 9: ver. 9. Iſai. 51: ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Now that this promiſe is a truth, and hath a certain accomplishment, the experience of the Saints in all ages will witnes, and we know their teſtimony is true, what at ſolemn times of Gods preſence they have had in a barren wildernes, how great a cloud of witneſſe, doth ſeal this, and give their teſtimony to the croſſe of Chriſt, of which we may ſay, the fame, and ſweet ſavour hath gone forth, and ſpread abroad through the Church, the Fathers have told it to the Children, and one generation to another, but hovv litle a part thereof can be expreſſed! I think it would be a marvellous record, if the ſuffering, and priſon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of the Saints vvere particularly ſet dovvn, vvhat they have ſound under the croſſe, but it is vvell, vve knovv this promiſe, hath been, and this day is evidently ſealed, concerning which I dare atteſt the experience of as many as did ever drink of this bleſſed cup, and were counted worthy to ſuffer for the teſtimony of Chriſt, if this be not a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, &amp; true witnes.</p>
               <p>Firſt that they have oft taſted what communion with God is, in the ſecret dueties of a Chriſtian, alſo in the publick ordinances, &amp; in a ſpecial meaſure, at ſome more ſolemn times, but, O! never knew his preſence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, more ſenſibly then under the croſſe, yea, have found that the work, and ſervice of a ſuffering time,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44187:41"/> as is it not the ordinary ſervice of every day, hath alſo a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and more then ordinary allowance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That they never knew divine ſtrength more ſenſibly, then when they have been moſt preſſed above their own ſtrength, that in the day they were caſt on Gods immediat care, and ordinary meanes of their help moſt withdrawen, they had never leſſe cauſe to complain, but might often ſay this as their experience; they thirſted not when he led them through the wildernes, yea, that they have no time of their life, found their mercyes more obſervably tryſt them, more ſweet, and ſatisfying then when by prayer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, they were put to digg the well, and wait for the rain coming down to fill it</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they never found more true liberty, then in the houſe of bondage, more refreshing company, then amidſt their greateſt ſolitude, while they found him near, whom gates, and barres cannot shut out, in the day when all things elſe ſeemed to frown upon them, that their midnight ſongs have been ſweeter, then all the proſperity they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enjoyed, and that they have oft proved, that the deeper any are in affliction for Chriſt, and his truth, they are alſo the deeper in conſolation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt ſay the moſt ſatisfying, and clear diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the vvord are under ſearching, and sharpeſt tryals, that a ſanctifyed exerciſing affliction, they have found one of the beſt interpreters of the bible, and the vvo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d then to be an other thing, then it is at other times, yea, even to have been that to them, vvhich they could deſire it to be ſo as they are ſure it hath been shaped out, and directed for that preſent plunge their ſoul was in.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That there is a very eaſy paſſage &amp; diſpatch, betvvixt Heaven, and an oppreſſed afflicted ſoul, an obſervable vent by prayer, and more ſenſible acceſſe to God face, vvhen other things have moſt frovvned. yea, they can vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from experience, he ſtayeth his rough vvind in the day of his Eaſt vvind. While he shutteth one doore he hath ſet an other open that vvhen the ſtorm vvithout hath been very sharp, they have found a ſweet calm, and ſun-shine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44187:41"/> within to make it eaſy, and when he layeth on one ſore tryal, he will take an other off.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They can tell what a ſweet comfortable parting, they have oft had, with ſome sharp tryal, that which at the firſt was bitter as death, hath in the cloſe, after ſanctified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe under the ſame, they have found cauſe to leave it their bleſſing; and they confeſſe that the time of greateſt jealouſy, and fear upon their part, they have found on Gods part hath been a time of greateſt kindnes, and love, the sharpeſt wounds from ſuch an hand, and heart as his, hath tended to a cure, yea, that circumſtance, and ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the ſame which of all was moſt bitter, and grievous, even there they have found their outgate &amp; encouragement moſt remarkable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the peculiar advantage of a ſanctifyed tryal, is not ſo well ſeen in the preſent time, as afterwards, when the caſe hath altered, then they found a long, and rough ſtorm recompenced at their landing, with a rich loadning of experience, an other kind of diſcovery of God, his way, &amp; the certainty of his word then they formerly had won to; ſo as now they can ſpeak of him, and the good of the croſſe, and adventuring any thing for Chriſt, with ſome greater eſteem, on ſome other ground, then report, or an hearing thereof by the ear.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I shall adde what hath been the frequent teſtimony of theſe who ever endured tribulation for the goſpel, that their remembrance, &amp; after reckoning, upon this account hath not been ſad, or bitter, when they ſat down, &amp; compared their gain with their loſſe, their upmaking with theſe dayes of tryal, that have gone over their head, that they would not then exchange their experience, or want what they have found by the croſſe, no not for many moe dayes of trouble, and affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SEVENTH Instance, is that promiſe of the word which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, in an evil time hath,</hi> that it shall preſerve their ſteps, and be the beſt mean to help theſe through that keep Gods
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44187:42"/> way, yea, even in this life shall not want ſome witnes of Gods reſpect. <hi>Pſ. 18: 25. Pſ. 112: 4. Rev. 3: 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to hold forth the accomplishment of this, I may with confidence appeal to the obſervation of the ſaints in all ages, who ever made it their ſerious ſtudy to keep their conſcrence, and their garments clean in a time of tryal, if their experience, hath not this teſtimony to give.</p>
               <p>Firſt that though at preſent, honeſty in evil times hath brought them in hazard, and with Joſeph to a priſon, yet, it hath brought them out alſo, with obſervable advantage, yea, how ever the Lord did order their outgate they have found; this did land them well, and alwayes bring them to a comfortable harboury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That honeſty, and faithfulnes hath an authority even on the conſcience of their enemies, &amp; leaveth uſually a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon them: Yea, hath forced a teſtimony, and approbation, from ſuch men, &amp; hath oft found better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, then theſe have who in a ſinful way have ſought to pleaſe them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have found this alwayes the choiſeſt expedient, and beſt policy in a dangerous time, which hath obſervably met them, when they had moſt to doe; A thing whereof they have reaped the fruits in the day of their ſtrait, and times of judgement, yea, though it hath occaſioned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metime their ſufferings, yet it hath been alſo their ſafety, and protection from ſadder ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That though integrity is oft under a dark cloud of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, yet it winneth ſtill well out from under the ſame, and hath shined uſuallyt more bright afterward. So as they might have had cauſe to obſerve, what unexpected meanes the Lord hath made uſe off, for their clearing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That while their enemyes might have (vvere it not for the preventing goodnes of God) quarrelled upon ſome other ground, they have been obſervably led, to purſue, and make them the but of their malice, for their honeſty and that wherein they have peace before God, and have been keeped from hitting on the right cauſe.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:44187:42"/>6. They finde how unſpeakably ſweet this is upon an after reckoning, and in the evening of their life, that then they reap a comfortable harveſt, of that they have ſown with much ſuffering, and teares; O! then it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them that integrity was their choice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They have ſometime found a hundred fold even in this life, and an obſervable upmaking in that, which they have been willing to loſſe, and hazard moſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They muſt alſo ſay, integrity was never their ruine, but an outgate was oft brought about in a way they could not have expected, yea the Lords shutting all other doores upon them, hath been that he might open one himſelfe, like Hagars wel ſpringing up in the wildernes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That in making this their aime, when they had a large heart for God, they have not then wanted an opportunity for evidencing the ſame, their encouragement hath abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their duty, and they have got much in, in giving much out for Chriſt, that there was no ſuch feaſt in the world, as they have ſenſibly found in the teſtimony of a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>EIGHT. Inſtance is that promiſe</hi> which is held forth to the Chriſtian in the word, <hi>of ſtrength, and aſſiſtance to go about duties. Iſ. 40: 29, 30, 31. Pſ. 18: 6, 14. Pſ. 84: 5. Pſ. 68: 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To clear this, that it hath an unqueſtionable performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, I atteſt the experience of the generation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; who ever knew what it was to ſerve the Lord in the ſpirit, who by many ſenſible confirmations, have not proven the certainty of theſe things?</p>
               <p>Firſt that when they have gone about duty under much deadnes, and ſtraitnes of ſpirit, they have found a very ſenſible enlargement, and got their bonds louſed, which ſurely they could no moe command, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of divine help, &amp; ſomething above nature, then theſe who ſpread out the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ail, can command a fair wind, when it is croſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44187:43"/>2. That Gods help, and concurrence, was never more diſcernable carrying them through, and making them ſtrong, then in the day, that, to their own ſenſe, they were moſt weak, when they have gone about duty under greateſt feares, and fainting in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when they had moſt confidence in themſelves, and judged they were at greateſt advantage in their going about ſome duty, they have uſually had the ſaddeſt retreat, and found that a ſure truth, the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They knew well what an influence divine concurrenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hath, not only upon their inward frame, but alſo upon the exerciſe of their gifts, yea, upon the commoneſt abilites of judgement, and memory, and that there is a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable difference, betwixt themſelves at one time, and an other, according to the blowing of this wind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They muſt alſo witneſs this as their experience, they found duty never more eaſy to them, then when they have had moſt to doe, and were keeped throngeſt therein; yea, when much work was laid to their hand, they then wanted not an enlarged allowance for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That their fpirits have been fitted for duty, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through difficulties, where at ſome other time, and in an other frame they would have fainted, and thereby ſeen, that none needs to ſcarr at piece of duty, when God calleth them to it, for while difficulties have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greateſt at firſt, the leſſe they have found them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yea, the hardeſt piece of ſervice oft made moſt eaſy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They finde God doth raiſe the ſpirit of his followers with a ſuitable elevation for their work, and can fit them for the ſervice of that time, and other tryals thereof, even beyond their ordinary reach.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That there is an open doore, and ſenſible aſſiſtance, when there hath been work for the Goſpel in ſuch a place, while on the other hand they have found, an inhibition ſenſibly ſerved on them, the doore as it were shut when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44187:43"/> the tide was going back, and the work of the Goſpel at a ſtand in ſuch a part.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That it is not greateſt abilities which make under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings ſuccesful, it being in vain to riſe up early without the Lord.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It hath oft been their experience, that in following the way of God, his candle did then shine upon their paths, the Spirit of the Lord was with them, and ſenſibly let out, the withdrawing wheteof hath been no leſſe diſcernable, while they turned aſide from him, that they have then been put to bear the burthen alone, and found difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and deſpondency of ſpirit at once growing upon their hand.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I may adde what theſe who are ſerious in Religion have oft tryed, that there is no ſuch help, and furniture, for going about duties as a ſpiritual frame, and nearnes with God, for then light, and counſel, inward freedome, and ſweet compoſure of ſpirit have brought moſt ſenſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, in their greateſt, yea and in their moſt common undertakings, this hath been very evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NINTH Instance, Is that great promiſe, we have</hi> Rom. 8: ver. 28. <hi>that all things shall work together for good to them who love God, and</hi> Pſal. 25: ver. 10. <hi>all the pathes of the Lord are mercy. and truth to ſuch as keep his Covenant.</hi> I confeſſe it is not eaſy ſometimes, to reconcile Gods way and this piece of his Word together, theſe who take only an ordinary paſſing look of providence, cannot well judge, how ſuch things, wherewith oft the godly in their life are tryſted, should contribute to their good, and advantage; while nothing would ſeem more directly croſſe to the ſame; But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and wiſe obſerver can give another account, they know what a ſure truth this is, that there is no real jarr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the promiſe and providence of God in this matter; and what ever be the preſent thoughts, patient on waiting hath had cauſe to ſay this.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:44187:44"/>1. When his way and their thoughts have moſt differed, in the accomplishment of his Word, and bringing about their mercy, they have found it was to their advantage, that his choice was alway better then theirs, yea they have been oft made to confeſſe, that their ſaddeſt diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein have tended to their further upmaking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Lords denying them, ſome outward thing which they have moſt deſired, they have found (as afterwards hath appeared) was to grant them more then their deſire; he hath refuſed them as it were in an Ishmael, that he might give them ane Iſaack.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They can oft ſay they had been undone if they had not been undone; that it was their mercy, the Lord took ſuch a way to caſt them in a fever, to prevent a lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and by ſome sharp croſſe, gave them a wound in the flesh, to cure and let out ſome groſſe impoſtume in their ſoul, which should have made their caſe worſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How greateſt shakings, have helped their further eſtablishment, ſo as they were never more confirmed then in that about which they have been moſt brangled; yea, they have alſo found this the Lords way to cure their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes, and misbeleef by ſome further addition to their croſſe; that when they would not beleeve, he hath cauſed them come in upon a greater diſadvantage, whileas a ſmall affliction, hath made them impatient, a more heavy, and preſſing trouble hath been their cure, and helped them to keep ſilence under Gods hand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the growing of difficulties in their way, and ſome further preſſure in the tryal, they have found, it was from the Lord, in order to its removal, and to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of ſome greater good, and that all viſible grounds of confidence, have been oft broken, but with this upmak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their mercy, they had it more immediatly out of Gods own hand, yea that the leſſe moderation was whileſt their tryal hath come to an extremity, they have found it then upon the turn, and their hope, and encouragemtn oft made to ſpring up therewith.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:44187:44"/>6. How the Lords deferring their mercy which they had oft ſought hath been indeed their mercy, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which did alwayes tryſt them in the ſeaſon, yea they muſt ſay his way is alwayes neareſt, and waiting on God without making haſte, dorh truely make the quickeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their experience can alſo witnes, how mens reproach and outing their malice that way to ruine their reputation, hath oft been the very mean, ordered by the Lord, to bring forth their further clearing, and vindication, even by that very mean.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How by ſome ſad croſſe, he doth oft prevent a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which though ſtrange at firſt, they have been forced upon after diſcovery to confeſſe: The man who riding in haſt to the ſea port, to have paſſage over ſeas with a ship going then off, fell, and broke his leg by the way, which was the ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng of his life, for the ship, and all its paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers perished in that voyage, yet, this was a bitter aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence to him for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. How their loſſe even by ſome ſad ſlip, and failing in their ſpiritual condition, hath really tended to their further humbling and advantage, yea, that which brought them under ſome viſible decay, as to the wonted luſtre of their Chriſtian profeſſion, hath freely helped them to grow more under ground, to the root, and ſubſtantialls of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They can tell how theſe ſteps of the providence of God, which ſeemed moſt croſſe to that deſign he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on, yea, looked like the very crushing of their hope, have oft been the very mean, which hath wrought moſt effectually to bring about their mercy.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I shall adde but this, as the Chriſtians witneſs to the truth of this promiſe, that sharpeſt reproofs they have ſeemed the wounds of a friend; moſt preſſing ſtraits, made the mean for their further enlargement, how the Lord hath brought them into ſome dark, and plunging tryal, which then looked like a fearful pitt, that he might bring them out with advantage, ſet their feet on a

               <p>
                  <hi>TENTH. Inſtance,</hi> I shall here ſet down, <hi>is that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promiſe made to Godlines, and theſe who make it t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eir ſerious ſtudy, that it shall be great gain that verily it shall be well with the righteous, for they shall eat the fruit of their labour; and in keeping of the command there is a great reward, 1 Tim. 6: 6. 1 Pet. 3: v. 12, 13. Pſal. 19: 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a great, concerning truth, but a truth which I am ſure none who did ever make earneſt of religion will call in qneſtion; many ſure convincing experiments hath the Chriſtian had thereof through his life, ſuch wants not ſome diary and record, wherein they can caſt up the advantage, they have reaped in cloſſe following of God, and their duty, yea from moſt remarkable providences, they may oft ſay, <hi>This I had becauſe I keeped thy precepts,</hi> now that this promiſe hath a large witnes, I shall here touch ſomethings which I may with ſome confidence ſay, both in the preſent, and in former times, hath been proved, and ſealed by the ſaints in their experience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they never more effectually conſulted their good, and advantage, then when they did with greateſt ſinglenes conſult their duty, and leaſt with flesh, and blood; they did never more truely ſeek themſelves, then in the practice of ſelf denyal, yea, in that they intended God moſt, and leaſt their privat intereſt, they have therein found a very ſenſible upmaking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a ſerious endeavour to walk before God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably they have found ſtill the beſt policy, even in the worſt of time, and have found his way then very ſatiſfying, while it was moſt their ſtudy how to pleaſe him, yea they have been oblidged to confeſſe, that when the Lords way was their choice, they have found it alſo their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44187:45"/>3. They have found more real joy and peace, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding temptations, then in any thing the temptation offered, and in laying their intereſt at Gods feet, and their will underneath his, more then in all their carnal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; O the truſt, and teſtimony of God appobation: how ſweet a ſmyle is his, in whoſe countenance Heaven lyeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That inward peace, and tranquillity of mynd, a ſweet calm, and compoſure of ſpirit, doth as really attend a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual frame, and walk, as the shadow the body, and their beſt, and moſt comfortable dayes, wherein they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walked at liberty, have been when their heart was moſt ſubject to the Law, with a ſingle reſpect to the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That religion, and a ſpiritual walk, is the beſt friend even as to a contented, and comfortable lyfe here in the World, &amp; that they have then moſt acceſſe to enjoy themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, &amp; their lot with ſatiſfaction, when they enjoy God, yea, that neernes, and communion with him, tendeth to the ſublimating, and refineing of their natural ſpirit, and hath been an obſervable help to their very common abilities and parts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there is truely a reality in the bleſſing, which maketh a ſmall thing ſignify much, and yeeld more, then greater abundance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That when they give God their heart, it is then ſweet, and matter of ſatiſfaction to obſerve his wayes, and their obſervation thereof is very refreshing, how far the Lord condiſcends to their deſires when they ſum them all up in himſelf, and make him their delight.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the pleaſure of religion is in the practice thereof, and the way to have religion eaſy, is to be throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, that duty is then ſweet when men doe act from an inward principle; and holines should be a more pleaſant work, yea, a reward to its ſelfe, if there were leſſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hypocrify.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That real humility, and walking low in their own eyes, and before God, did never loſe to them reſpect,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44187:46"/> and credit from men; but ſelf abaſement doth obſervably go before lifting up, and true honour followeth ſuch, who leaſt hunt after vain applauſe from the world.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That when they were moſt faithful to obſerve, and improve a little for their enconragement, more hath been added, and they never wanted matter to be thankful, when opportunities laid to their hand were improved and taken hold of for that end, yea, they have found there is a mercy within a mercy, and ſome peculiar mercy in every croſſe, which is only found and brought forth, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed ſerious improver of the ſame,</p>
               <p n="11">11. That much ſincerity hath alſo much ſenſe following the ſame, ſecret honeſty before God, hath mett them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly before men, and faithfulnes in Chriſtian freedome purchaſed them more favour, and reſpect even from the worſt, then when they ſtudied moſt to pleaſe them in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That they never ſavv more clearly the gain, and real advantage of Godlines, and vvhat a difference there is betvvixt theſe that ſerve God, and theſe that ſerve him not, as in a time of trouble, and ſtrait, hovv then tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in their former vvalk, and that vvhich they entertained in the morning, doth novv meet them at night, and pay them home vvith advantage in ane houre of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They vvere forced to obſerve that there vvas an inviſible guard about his People in their duty, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Angels tovvards ſuch is no deluſion, and thar they have oft been made to vvonder ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hazard vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hairbreadth, hath been prevented; relief, and help come as betvvixt the bridge, and the vvater, hovv they have been ſenſibly preſerved amidſt greateſt dangers, while as it were an inhibition hath been ſerved upon theſe, that they should come near, but not hurt, and only mett with them, that they might read their preſervation from them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That an enlarged heart doth meet with an enlarged allowance, and bearing burthen with others of the People
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44187:46"/> of God, hath helped to make their own privat burthen the lighter.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That real godlines, and religion, hath as much in hand, as it may be a reward to its ſelf; which beautifieth the ſoul, and maketh the face, and converſation to shine with an obſervable luſtre; that guardeth and preſerveth the heart from many vexing croſſes; preventeth ſad ſtroakes, and ſorrowes that others are pierced with, who will follow their idols, and the wayes of ſin, which are bitter in the cloſe.</p>
               <p>In a word, this is ſurely found, that God is the beſt friend, and when there is peace with him, things without doe not offend, but they shall then underſtand what it is to be in league with the beaſts of the field and ſtones of the ground, having a ſweet aggreement, with all the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and diſpenſations that come in their way.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>That the ſcripture threatnings have alſo a certain aceomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are found to be ſad earneſt, &amp; do not fall to the ground, the Chriſtian can alſo ſeal from his experience.</p>
               <p>It is not here to be underſtood the threatnings of wrath (from which beleevers are freed in Chriſt,) but of a fatherly diſpleaſure, which becauſe of ſin, may draw deep, yea, bring forth very dreadful effects, to witnes rhat it is an evil, &amp; bitter thing to depart from God, &amp; that their own doings shall chaſtiſe them; &amp; theſe threatnings of the Covenant, if <hi>thy children for ſake my law, I will punish their tranſgreſſions with rods, &amp;c. Pſ. 89: ver.</hi> 30. are ſure truths which want not in every time a performance.</p>
               <p>To clear this (ere I ſpeak any thing particularly) I would premit ſomethings to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the word is a perpetual rule, which in every time muſt take place, and though affliction is a peece of the common miſery of man, yet, doth it not ariſe out of the duſt, neither fall out at an adventure, but doth oft viſibly follow the tract of ſin, as a ſlouth-hound, pointing at ſuch evils as the cauſe, by the ſtroak, &amp; at the truth and fulfilling of the threatnings, written upon both.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:44187:47"/>2. We should adore his ſoveraignty whoſe way both in the meaſure, and manner of his peoples chaſtiſement is ſo various, as that none can infallibly conclude, what he is to do in ſuch a caſe, I mean we are not to limit the Lord, to ſuch a way, and method in his working; yet, this we may aſſert, and firmly conclude, that not only the threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the word have a performance, but men may alſo have, even before hand ſome more then probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, yea, a clear diſcovery, what ſuch a caſe doth thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aten, &amp; what will be the iſſue of a ſinful courſe, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Lords ordinary procedure, both with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, how ſin, hath very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d effects, and his way in all ages, is ſtill uniforme agreeing with its ſelfe, &amp; with the word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though a gracious ſtate doth ſurely priviledge from wrath, and condemnation, yet not from affliction, &amp; ſad ſtroaks of divine anger becauſe of ſin; for he taketh ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on mens inventions, even when he will ſpare the inventors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord doth oft contend with his people for their folly, and miſcarriages, more ſeverely then with others, &amp; will not let paſſe in them that which he paſſeth by in the world, without being a reprover; but when light, and love and the law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll not hedge in their way, he will ſet briars, and thornes, before them, yea, ſpeak by chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement upon their bones, to withdraw men from their purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is known, how very deep the holy anger of God, may draw againſt his children, even ſometimes, to purſue them out of the land of the living, and follow them to the grave, with ſome remarkable ſtroak, yea it hath made them dreadful examples of judgment in this life, for whom, he hath accepted an eternal ſacrifice in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I shall adde, this is the Lords bleſſed end in making out his threatnings, againſt his people, that they should not perish with the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. O, what a bleſt exchange is it, that the flaming ſword which once ſtood to guard the tree of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44187:47"/> life, doth now ſtand, as it were in the way of the ſaincts, to keep them from running into the pathes of death.</p>
               <p>Having premitted theſe things, I shall now inſtance, ſome particular evils, wherewith the godly are ready to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, which the word, doth expreſly threaten, and hold forth the hazard of, both as to outward, and ſpiritual ſtroakes, and give in here the Chriſtians witnes from their experience in all ages of the truth of theſe thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST. Securitly, &amp; carnal confidence,</hi> which we finde the word doth threaten is an evil wherewith Chriſtians are ready to be overtaken; but they do alſo know by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, what bitter fruit this doth bring forth, and that therein the word falleth not to the ground, whileſt from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tryal, they finde.</p>
               <p>Firſt that a ſecure condition is the uſual forerunner of ſome ſad change, that when they are moſt at eaſe in a dul, and dead temper of ſpirit, ſome sharp rouſing diſpenſation is upon the back of it, either a groſſe ſin, or a ſearching croſſe, as a thorn in the bed of their ſecurity to put them to their fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Hoſ. 7: 9, 12. Hoſ.</hi> 2: 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2, That ſeldom reckoning with the conſcience, the running on of counts for ſometime upon their hand, doth ravel their caſe, unto a ſad confuſion &amp; maketh it a bitter, and heartleſſe work to retire alone, or within themſelves, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, hath a moſt direct tendency to a further hardening, &amp; real upgiving with their dnty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when ſecurity, &amp; deadnes groweth within, it qnickly maketh them dry up, &amp; wither without, in the external performance of duty, &amp; in that vigorous, lively appearance which did formetly luſtre their walk, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage before others, ſo as very by ſtanders may read the languishing of grace, in the dead exerciſe of their gifts.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That going about duty with moſt confidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves doth uſually give them the moſt clear diſcovery of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44187:48"/> their weakneſs, yea, when they have leaſt lookt for any croſſe, they have then been ſure to meet with it with that ſad addition, of being a ſurprizal in a ſecure condition, where as on the other hand they may tell, what refreshing diſappointments they have got where ſome tryalls have been moſt feared and lookt for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſecure ſporting with a temptation, may ſoon turn to ſad earneſt and they have found it very hard to dance about the fire, and not be burnt, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at a diſtance ſeemed ſmall upon a neerer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they have found had moe bands on their heart, and was another thing then they could have beleeved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the meanes whereon they have laid moſt weight, they have alſo found, have given them the ſaddeſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, the putting of them in Gods room, and out of their own place, hath been the way to cauſe them miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea, to turn their croſſe, whereas they have oft ſeen ſomething unexpected, made the mean of their help, that they might know meanes are ordered of the Lord, and are uſeful, becauſe he maketh them ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their experience can alſo witneſs that carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence deſpiſing the tryal at a diſtance, uſually punished with carnal diffidence, and deſpondency of ſpirit under the ſame, the one extremity made the punishment of the other, like the hote, and cold fits of an ague, which doe mutually make one the other more intenſe, yea, that their immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat confidence, and expectation of a thing, hath after reſolved in as immoderat diſcouragement, as their ſtroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND. The Chriſtians unwatchfulnes,</hi> and intermitting in the exerciſe of that ſo neceſſary and commanded duty, we finde the Word threateneth, and holdeth forth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard thereof; <hi>Lest ye enter into temptation,</hi> the outmaking whereof their experience can alſo witnes, <hi>Luk. 21: v. 34, 36. Math: 26: ver.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:44187:48"/>1. That it is not eaſy to guid their walk, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when their guard over the heart doth ſlacken, but the giving looſe rains for a little, may make ſuch a ſad, and large breach, that many many dayes will not eaſily make up, yea they doe alſo know, how a ſenſible withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit, and drying up of their life, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the uſual fruit which unwatchfulnes brings forth.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That this helpeth to make their ſun-blincks short, cauſeth a low ebbe after the greateſt enlargement, whileſt they doe not guard againſt their peculiar evils and that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually there doth haunt ſuch a condition, the ſwelling of the flesh, when the ſpirit is moſt enlarged, which will ſoon put them as far behind, as they formerly thought themſelves at an advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That vvhen once the heart lyeth open, it is quickly ſeiſed on, and made a prey, with what a bitter ſting doth it return, after it hath taken liberty to wander? yea, doth find there is a ſwift progreſſe that ſin hath from the thoughts to the rolling of it to the imagination, and thence to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wherewith it is more eaſy to engadge, then to shake this off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That unwatchfulnes hath oft turned the moſt ſpecial times, and opportunities for advantage to the greateſt loſſe, which through their neglect of theſe, hath put them further behind then they were, it hath turned their retirement, and ſolitude, to be their ſnare, made the deſert worſe, and more dangerous then the city, and made them finde that vain thoughts the following whereof ſeemeth pleaſant to the mouth, will prove gall, and vvormvvood in the belly, there being no ſadder company then a mans ſpirit let looſe upon it ſelfe, whileſt they cannot ſtop that current, whereto they had given a vent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their experience of this can vvitnes that unvvatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, hath an undoubted tendency to caſt of prayer, hovv hard is it in the evening to retire to God, vvhileſt the heart is abroad all the day? To be Religions in Worship, when men are not ſo in their vvalk? Yea they doe find that this vvill bring their diſtemper vvithin, out at doors to ſome
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44187:49"/> diſorder, impertinency, or paſſion in their words, or outward communication, a thing which experience may tell doth wound the ſoul, make a ſad breach in their peace, and doth quickly overcloud the Spirit, and unfit them for communion with God, and going about of ſpiritual duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRD. To reſtrain prayer, and neglect calling on God is ane evil alſo which the Word doth threaten,</hi> and hold forth the ſame hazard thereof, as of unwatchfulnes, <hi>lest ye enter into temptation,</hi> yea, that this is even a ſtep to the caſting off fear, the Chriſtians experience, from frequent tryal can witnes, that this Scripture threatning is true, <hi>Math. cap. 26: vor. 41. Heb. 15: ver. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That they have found this the riſe, which giveth life, and increaſe to their prevailing evils, &amp; that corruption then is upon a ſenſible grouth, as the lively exerciſe of prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be intermitted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this weareth out their ſpiritual life, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a conſumption upon the vital ſpirits of Chriſtianity, ſo that theſe who ſometime flowrished, and kept green, as by the ſent of water, that correſpondence which they had with the fountain of their life, while his dew did ly all night on their branches, hath through neglect of prayer, been brought to a poor shadow, ſo although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the greatnes of their loſe and diſtemper, hath been hid from themſelves, yet, might be eaſyly diſcerned by onlookers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That wearing out of prayer, and of delight therein, will quickly make them diſrelish any other piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, put them out of frame, to meditat; or to give thanks, or entertain fellovvship vvith the Saints, yea, the more lively, and ſpiritual theſe are, it maketh them the more a burden, and torm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That vvearing out of this, is a ſtrong temptation to a further forbearance, and vvill ſenſibly vvear them out of any ſenſe of their need hereof; and make them ſtrangers to themſelves and to their ovvn caſe, ſo that they shall ſinde,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44187:49"/> the leſſe they are in this exerciſe, the further they shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed and the fewer errands they have, the leſſe felt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their experience can alſo witnes that litle prayer maketh a heavy burden, doth multiply their ſtraits, and cauſe their care grow as this is abaited; they muſt then bear their burden alone, and with heavines take counſel within themſelves, while they ply not this bleſt tryed remedy to make their requeſts, in all things known to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOVRTH. We find the Word doth threaten defection from the truth,</hi> and turning from the way of God in a time of tryal, as an evil into which, theſe that are kept by grace from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal apoſtaſie, may yet through the violence of a temptation, fall, <hi>Ierem. 9: ver. 13: 15. Pſal. 89: ver. 30, 32. Ioſ. 8: v. 11.</hi> and their ſad experience can witnes, the truth of the Scripture threatnings concerning this alſo, while they have found.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in one day they mayt adventure on that, which through moſt of their life they have not win above, but hath made them go with their back bowed down to the grave; that their giving the Lords work, a wrong touch, is one of theſe things which doth ſcarcely leave them all their time, but, beyond other ſins they have found this ſtill come up with a bitter, and heavy reflexion, yea, in the evening of their life they have found this ſo ſore on their ſpirit, that it could not ly hid or ſilent but they were forced to witnes their ſenſe of it before the World, ere they could win to any eaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this the Lord doth uſually meet, with ſome sharp and publick reproof even before men that though he pardon his People, yea, give ſome ſenſible intimation thereof to their ſouls, yet, he hath not paſt them, as to ſome viſible mark of his diſpleaſure, becauſe of ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſee that a crooked, and uncleanly way proves not the mean of extricating them out of trouble, but their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44187:50"/> ſtraits have been made to grow therewith, yea they have found that which they eshewed in Gods way, hath more ſadly tryſted them in another rod, and that there is a thick dreg in the bottom of the cup, which maketh it worſe to drink thereof at the cloſe, then at the beginning.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is not eaſy to make a ſtand in turning aſide from the way of God, when once they are engadged, and that a retrograd motion is very violent, and yeelding in a little will bring with it ſome neceſſity of going further, as a judicial ſtroke.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſitting of ſome clear opportunity, to give a teſtimony for the truth, when called thereto, hath turned to be their judgement, that they should not have further acceſſe, or be made uſefull that vvay; a thing truely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to ſuch, as are vviſe to obſerve the judgements of God in their time; yea, likevviſe that publick backſliding, doth oft viſibly vvear men out of perſonal tendernes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIFTH. Unſubduedneſſe of ſpirit, and want of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to outward things, the Word doth clearly threaten,</hi> and hold out its hazard, the accomplishment vvhereof, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians experience can vvitneſs, <hi>Rom. 8: ver. 6, 7.</hi>

               <head>SECOND ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND Argument to demonſtrat the accomplishment of the ſcripture is this, that not only Christian experience, but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church and people of God, doth in all ages bear witnes thereto, how the Lords way in theſe providences both of mercy, and judgement, about the Church, amidſt the various changes of her condition, yea, in the moſt ſtrange things which fall out in the world, doth convincingly anſwer the word, and verify the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is indeed undenyable that the ſcripture of God, as it is written to the perſonal caſe of his people, and doth in their experience take place, ſo is there a part of it in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way directed to the Church, the fulfilling whereof in the providences, and events of the time should be the ſubject of our obſervation, and would ſingularly help to confirm our faith of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>For proſecuting this argument I would touch it a litle in theſe three branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How theſe General promiſes which belong to the chureh univerſal, and concern her in all ages, have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44187:51"/>2. How theſe threatnings alſo of the word which doe not only concern the church, but have a reſpect to her adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes are certainly fulfilled, &amp; take place in mens obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who do obſerve the judgements of their time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How the Scripture of God doth clearly shine upon the darkeſt footſteps of providence, even theſe which would ſeem moſt ſtrange, and hard to underſtand, ſo that it may be demonſtrat nothing falleth out in the world, or befalleth the ſaincts, but what is moſt conſonant to the ſcripture.</p>
               <div n="1" type="branch">
                  <p>FIRST BRANCH As to the firſt branch of this argument, I shall but inſtance five general promiſes, which we finde held forth in the word concerning the church, and endeavour to shew how very clear, and obvious the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of them is, if men do not willingly shut their own eyes.</p>
                  <p>FIRST Promiſe wherein we find the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, is the <hi>preſervation of the Church</hi> that he will be with her to the end of the world, and though he make an end of other nations, yet, will he not make an utter end of her; but while the ordinances of the ſun, and the moon doe laſt, and as the dayes of heaven, ſo shall her dayes be prolonged, againſt her the gates of hell shall not prevail. <hi>Pſ. 49: ver. 16. Math. 16: 18.</hi> Now that God hath truely verifyed this his promiſe &amp; is as good as his word, is a truth though marvellous, yet, ſo very clear, and manifeſt, that I am ſure no Atheiſt can deny, it may be ſo eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Church doth continue, and is kept alive to this day, it doth certainly prove the truth of his promiſe, for it can be ſaid of her, &amp; none can ſay it is a lye, she hath outlived all her oppoſers, the greateſt of whom have found their grave in the quarrel, over whoſe tomb that laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of a great adverſary <hi>Iulian</hi> may be written <hi>viciſti tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Galilaee,</hi> hath not this deadly, and irreconciliable feed been perpetuat, from fathers to children, but who hath proſpered in that enterpriſe, the archers have oft shot,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44187:52"/> and wounded her ſore, but her bow doth abide in ſtrength, as at this day, this is her <hi>motto, perſecuted but not forſaken, cast doun, but not diſcouraged,</hi> she who hath brought forth many children, yet, ceaſeth not to bear whoſe age hath not marred her beauty, her eyes are not dimm, hor her ſtrength failed, a ſight which may cauſe us no leſſe ſtand, and conſider this great wonder, theu Moſes did at that; which was but the shadow, and embleme thereof, a bush, burning, and not conſumed, for behold a church kepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, yet, ſtill in the flames, and when to appearance conſumed it doth ariſe more glorious out of her own ashes, this is indeed the only <hi>Phanix,</hi> and we know no other, of whom that can be ſaid, hath she not born out theſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deluges, which did like an inundation go over her head, of idolatry, and paganiſme in the firſt times, and Antichriſtianiſm with Arrianiſm in the after ages, yet not ſwallowed up, which may be no leſſe marvellous then when she was keept above the waters in the ark, and though her enemyes, have oft ſung her funeral ſong, and rejoyced over the dead, the dead bodyes of her witneſſes, yet, they have riſen again, her drie bones have taken life, and come together, and behold she is alive at this day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the Churches preſervation, but the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeries, and ſucceſſion thereof unto this time, doth witnes the fulfilling of this promiſe, that in the darkeſt times, of her condition, she hath not altogether diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, even, when she was ſo long hid in the wildernes, but ſtill in every age, had ſome witneſſes, and though the Church hath oft cryed out for the want of Children, and been heard weeping, bemoaning her ſelf becauſe they were not; yet, we may ſay she never wanted an ofſpring, to this day, shee did never dye without an heir, and ſeed of her own, to raiſe up her name, even ſince the Covenant was firſt made with her, in Adams family, and though particular Churches have their ſet times which like the ſun, have theſe uſuall periods, their firſt riſe, their height, and flowrishing, and afterwards a gradual decay, making way to the departure of the light, yet, this made never
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44187:52"/> void the promiſe of God to the Church univerſal, whoſe lamp was never put out, nay, shall not while the dayes of Heaven doe laſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt alſo ſay that the continuance, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church, is peculiar to her alone, and can be ſaid of no other intereſt and party beneath the ſun, for it is clear that there was no Kingdome, or empire ſo firmly rooted, no ſociety ſo well governed by Lawes, backed with power, which hath had the beſt title, and claim, but time at laſt did prevail over it, and made the ſame a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee of her conqueſt; yea, the greateſt Monarchies, and flowrishing cities, have at laſt yeelded, ſo as of them it may be ſaid, <hi>nunc ſeges eſt ubi Troia fuit,</hi> but time cannot to this day, boaſt of a triumph over the Church of God, though no nation, no family, in the earth could ever plead antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with her: This is that intereſt, which hath born out all theſe great revolutions that ſo oft changed the very face of the world, yea, hath outlived ſo many Kingdomes, and ſucceſſions thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It doth convincingly demonſtrat the truth of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Churches preſervation, that the World, yea, greateſt Athieſts may ſee, this hath not come to paſſe, at an adventure, nay, not in an ordinary way of providence, but, by a divine power, moſt diſcernable therein; while it is ſo clear. 1. That no intereſt, or party had ever ſuch adverſaries, as the Church, againſt whom the powers of the World, and the powers of darknes have alwayes been on foot. 2. That outward advantages have uſually been on her adverſaries ſide, not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ilities. 3. That there will was never wanting to their power, and their deſigne no leſſe then to raze her to the foundation. 4. That this enimity hath been rooted, and irreconciliable, which time to this day could never take up. 5. That no intereſt did ever endure, ſuch violent aſſaults, ſo many sharp batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for it is obſervable that moſt of the wars, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of every age, have been ſome way ſtated on the Churches account, and what ever privat quarrels men have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44187:53"/> had among themſelves, yet it hath not hindred the purſuit of their malice, againſt the woman, and her ſeed. 6. That ſuch who have come out of her bowels, even the men of her own houſe, have oft been her greateſt enemyes; and lyen in wait to take her at an advantage in the day of her halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 7. That her reall friends have oft fainted in a time of her ſtrait, and ſtood afar off, yea, almoſt none of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which shee had brought forth, have been then found to take her by the hand; 8. That the depths of Satan, in her enemyes, as an angel of light, have ſometimes given her a ſore aſſault, ſo that if it had been poſſible, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary midſes could have reacht their end, they should have deceived the very elect. 9. I muſt adde this further witnes to the marvellous preſervation of the Church, which in an ordinary way could not come to paſſe, that we find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party was ever brought ſo low and near death, to be yet alive, the knife was once at the Churches throat in <hi>Iſaack.</hi> she did ſeek to adopt a bound-womans ſonne in ſtead of a lawful heir, when <hi>Abraham</hi> agreed to <hi>Sara's</hi> overture for the outmaking of the promiſe; how near exſpiring doe we finde her in Egypt, when a ſentence to deſtroy all her male iſſue was gone forth? Yea, what but a miracle could have preſerved her, when she was betwixt Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and the red ſea? How low was the Church in the wildernes, and after in the dayes of the captivity, even broken to pieces with ſmall appearance of life, when her face was all blurred with weeping, and her enemyes made ſport over her ruines at the rivers of Babylon, when the Children of Edom cryed out let us raze her even to the foundation? Yea, could the Church be nearer the grave, then when her bones were ſcattered, at the graves mouth, bnt above all in that dark night when her head, and shepheard was ſmitten, and her hope ſeemed to be buried in the grave with a ſtone put upon it, when shee could get no entertainment among the Jewes, was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of her friends, and the Gentils in wrath roſe up againſt her, that for ſome hundred Yeares the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which had trod down all the nations about, put forth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44187:53"/> the outmoſt of power, and malice for her undoing. O who could have thought the Church should outlive this? Yea, after all we finde her toſt, and hurried by Antichriſt into the wildernes, an adverſary more cruel then any that had gone before, where the Dragon watcht to get her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but how in all theſe, and through that long dark night she hath continued and marvellouſly flowrished, as the palm tree, under her greateſt weights; ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but ſee that which her enemies being judges will not deny, that this promiſe to the Church of her preſervation is this day fulfilled, yea, that it hath not in an ordinary way been brought about; ſurely there is no inchantment againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor divination againſt Iſrael, all her enemyes have been found lyers, happy art thou above other People, for the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armes, elſe long ſince she should have been ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; may we not ſtill ſay with aſtonishement. O what hath God wrought in her behalfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SECOND Promiſe,</hi> Which I shall here inſtance, that God had made to his Church, in the Word; <hi>Of her increaſe and enlargement,</hi> that the Earth should be covered with the knowledge of God, as the ſea of water, and her ſeed be as the ſtars of Heaven, that her bounds should be from the ſea to the utmoſt rivers, which was promiſed to Chriſt in the behalfe of his Church and that shee should poſſeſſe the gates of her enemyes. <hi>Pſal. 89: v. 25.

                     </gap> is expreſſe in the Scripture, we muſt ſay it is no leſſe clear, and evident in its accomplishment, that ſurely the Lord hath keept his Word, whereto the event doth moſt exactly anſwer, and though yet it be not to the full made out, I am ſure there is ſo much at this day mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, conſidering the former condition of the Church, as undenyably proveth the fulfilling of the formentioned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which even to the conviction of greateſt Atheiſts may be demonſtrat from theſe grounds.</p>

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:44187:54"/>1. That vaſt extent which the Kingdome of Chriſt hath had in the World, for this cannot be denyed, that the greateſt Empire, or Monarchy could never ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea croſſed the ſeas, to the dark northern nations, thus fulfilling its courſe, in order to its return again, to the place of its firſt riſing, that it may, as we are ſure it shall once viſit the Jewes again, and the eaſtern places of the World that now are buried in a night of darknes, which I think will be as ſure a preſage of the break of day, and ſecond coming of the Lord, as the morning Star is to the World of the Suns accomplishing its courſe, and that it is returning again to the Eaſt were it should riſe; hath not the Goſpel now, been through Aſia where it did not tarry for a night, for many flowri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ruely in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and hath Europe though laſt, been leaſt on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Yea, what do mean the late diſcoveries of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known parts of the Earth, but to make way for a more full performance of this promiſe, that the Goſpel might ſtretch its conqueſt over the line, which ſurely was the gold and treaſure Chriſt deſignd from thence that even America might have her day alſo, and the voice of the turtle be heard in theſe lands,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:44187:54"/>2. Not only the large extent of the Church as to its bounds doth witnes this, but alſo the great, and numerous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Sons &amp; Daughters which in theſe parts where the Goſpel hath been were brought forth to Chriſt, for we may ſay, what Iohn ſaw in viſion hath been very manifeſt to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages an innumerable company of all Tongues, Nations and Languages, of whom it could be ſaid theſe are born in Zion, O how great a harveſt of the Nations, is even alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gathered? What a fleece hath every particular Church caſt? What a marvellous increaſe, hath been in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after ſpecial tydes of the Goſpel? May we not ſay that truth is now beyond debate, that out of one, and him not onely as good as dead, but truely dead, there hath come forth as the ſand of the ſea, and Stars of Heaven in number, the Church hath inherited Joſephs bleſſing of the womb, and the breaſts, in a fruitful ofſpring, the dew of Chriſts youth hath been as the womb of the morning. O what a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and goodly company will this once be, when ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together? Then will the performance of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſes be fully manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This truth may be demonſtrat not only from the reall conqueſt of the Goſpel, and theſe excellent trophees of her victory over many noted enemyes, who have after been veſſels of honour, but alſo from the feigned ſubjection that ſo many have been made to render, is it not ſtrange, what a multitude doth in theſe times profeſſe the truth, and yet, hate it, and were never drawn with the cords of love? How very many have courted the name of a Chriſtian, and wooed the shadow of religion, who never knew the truth thereof, which certainly is a convincing evidence of the Goſpels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that ſo many knees should bow to the name of Jeſus, whoſe hearts were never bowed, or really ſubdued to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is an unanſwerable proof of this truth that we ſee the churches increaſe, &amp; enlargement hath come to paſſe moſt punctually after that manner, yea, with all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as was fortold and promiſed, ſo that the event doth in every thing anſwer the word, for, Firſt it is there held out, that from a day of ſmall things vvhich men would be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44187:55"/> ready to deſpiſe, it should grow up as a tender plant, and ſpread forth its branches over the nations, that the children of the deſolat should be moe then of the married Wife, and the glory of the ſecond temple, exceed that of the firſt, &amp; O! hath it not accordingly come to paſſe? 2. This great increaſe, and enlargement of the church was to fall out in the dayes of the new teſtament, when Chriſt should be lifted up, that then he should draw all men after him; for theſe promiſes we have thereof in the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe clearly point at the times of the goſpel, &amp; doth not the event here accordingly anſwer? 3. The ſcripture holdeth out that the falling away of the Jewes, should be the riches of the gentils, and that their rejection should make way for the fulfilling of this promiſe even the inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the nations, and doe not men ſee the event with this very circumſtance?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We find the iſles, and outmoſt parts of the earth are given to Chriſt, for his inheritance, and foretold as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of the Churches increaſe, and do we not clearly ſee there is no place of the world, where Chriſt's Kingdome is more viſible, where moe children have been begot to him by the goſpel, we may ſay, then in theſe northern places, even in theſe Iſles of Britain, &amp; Ireland, which are almoſt the uttermoſt parts of the earth, there being but litle from that airth, and nearer the pole which is inhabited, yea, we may judge hath been that <hi>Thule</hi> whereof the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did ſo much ſpeak. 5. Was it not alſo foretold that the church should poſſeſſe the gates of her enemyes, at whoſe great increaſe the world should wonder, the princes thereof ſee, and be troubled while God is known in her palaces for a refuge, and doth not the event witnes this, that over all theſe counſels, and eſſayes which the world, hath had to hinder the churches grouth, her riſing hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been upon the ruines of her greateſt enemyes, yea, theſe who have been a terrour in the land of the living did oft fall, and break themſelves in that attempt, can men deny the marvellous progreſſe of the church how from a ſmall beginning shee at laſt poſſeſſed the gates, of both the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44187:55"/> eaſt, and weſtern empire her old enemyes, and do we not this day ſee her conqueſt advancing on the ruines of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, her laſt, and greateſt adverſary.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the fulfilling of this promiſe anent the churches increaſe is undenyable, ſince men cannot contradict their ſenſe therein, we muſt alſo ſay this is a thing great, and marvellous, which no leſſe then ſome divine, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power could bring about, if we conſider theſe things; firſt, that quick diſpatch which the churches grouth, under the dayes of the new Teſtament hath made. O might not the pagan world wonder how in the ſpace of two or three hundred years, it was almoſt become wholly chriſtian; O ſtrange! a <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximus</hi> ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſecuting, and trampling on the very name of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity &amp; yet near that ſame age, this great Roman empire, and Emperour ſubmitting to the goſpel which was fulfilled in the dayes of Conſtantine. 2. How aſtonishing was it for the churches riſe, and increaſe to be brought about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruine, and dounfal of the idols of the nations, who had their temples, and were worshipped as God, that the world should be made to renounce its Bible, and that religion which for ſo many ages was deeply rooted by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from their fathers; theſe altars which were had in ſuch reverence, demolished, and their temples made a ruinous heap, yea, the very name of their Gods should be thus obliterat, was not this indeed very wonderful? But Dagon hath no ſtrength to ſtand before the ark of the God of Iſrael. 3. That it should be thus advanced by ſuch a mean as the preaching of the word, even of that which to the Jewes was a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes, how this voice, should put to perpetual ſilence theſe Oracles that for ſo many ages, had given a reſponſe to the world, might be indeed aſtonishing, yea, that the churches increaſe should thus be brought about, at no leſſe rate, then the overturning of greateſt Kingdomes, the converſion of ſo many nations, should tame, and civilize the moſt ſavage, and barbarous, cauſe the lion to ly doun with the lamb, and even make ſo great and univerſal a change
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44187:56"/> in the face of the univerſe. 4. Doth it not ſpeak forth ſome divine power the carrying on of the churches grouth, and increaſe not only over the violence of men, but over all theſe dreadful errours, and inventions, theſe thick miſts which both in former, and late times, have aſcended out of the pit to choke her, that we may ſay, the church hath not onely been helpt to tread upon the lion, and dragon, but ou the adder, and cockatrice alſo, and doth carry the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees of her conqueſt over all theſe at this day. 5. I would adde is it not marvellous how the churches increaſe, hath been advanced in a way moſt contrare to all the rules of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary policy, by which ſtates, and empires have riſen, not by diſſimulation, but greateſt plaines, and free dealing for Chriſt, and his Miniſters did never flatter the world to embrace the truth; not by open violence, but a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit. &amp; power before which men could not ſtand, where foolishnes was made to confound, and outwit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, and weaknes to overcome ſtrength that we may ſay, O how litle of man, and much of God was to be ſeen therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THIRD Promiſe</hi> which the Lord hath given to his church in the word, is <hi>the giving of the Spirit &amp; powring out of the ſame,</hi> which is there expreſly held forth, &amp; promiſed, <hi>Zach. 12: 10. Ioh. 14: 17. Pſ.</hi> 59: 21. And doth concern all the times of the church, though in a more full meaſure, to be let out in the dayes of the Goſpel,</p>
                  <p>It is true the Chriſtians inward experience can beſt witnes this, for theſe have an argument from within; they know, and they are ſure they have received the ſpirit by the word, whereby they underſtand, theſe things which are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned; but that which here is intended, it is to shew, that the ſpirit is truely let forth to the church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe, that it doth accompany the truth, and doctrine of Chriſt, and purity of the ordinances, as a thing which from clear undenyable evidences, may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat to the conviction of the greateſt Atheiſt: for I muſt think even byſtanders, ſuch who never knew any ſaving
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44187:56"/> work of the ſpirit, but live in theſe parts where the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are diſpenſed with purity, and power, if they shut not their eyes, may oft clearly ſee ſomething going forth with the word, that is beyond words, a divine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and power which ſendeth forth its ſavour in the dayly adminiſtration of the goſpel, yea, by its effects, and ſome convincing diſcovery thereof, doth force this truth in upon mens conſciences, who are otherwayes ſtrangers thereto.</p>
                  <p>Now to hold forth the accomplishment of ſo great a promiſe that God is faithful, and true therein, I would give in theſe clear, and convinceing witneſſes to the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe excellent gifts, and enduments given to the Church, are they not a viſible proof of this truth? For it is undenyable, where once the goſpel cometh that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are raiſed with another ſpirit, reapers ſent forth, while there is a harveſt to be gathered, and shaped for their work, yea, theſe who were of mean, and ordinary parts, when called forth to the ſervice of the Church, will have another luſtre, that it may be oft ſeen with aſtonishment, how far not only they exceed themſelves but theſe who were of more eminent natural enduments, I would but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ask men who never laid this truth to heart whence is that variety of Gifts, ſo ſutably diſpenſed to the various em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and different pieces of ſervice, the Church doth call for; how are they thus ſuted to the ſeveral times, yea, to the very genius, and temper of ſuch a time? Whence is it, that every gift, and qualification is ſo fitted, and diſpoſed for its proper uſe, ſome moſt peculiarly shaped out to awake, and threaten, theſe <hi>Boanerges,</hi> while others are ſet forth with a ſpirit eminently fitted to comfort; ſome mighty in perſwaſion, yet not ſo fit to expound; others moſt dexterous to inſtruct, yet, not ſo powerfull to apply; ſome the gift of tongues, and others the tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary; to ſome the face of a lyon is given, when a heroick ſpirit of courage, and reſolution is called for, to others the face of a calf for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44187:57"/> patient enduring in ſufferings times, ſurely it were a choice meditation to think how with as great wonder, we may ſay of this excellent body of the Church, as of the natural body of man, how curious, yea, marvellouſly is it framed, where every part doth anſwer another, and to the uſe of the whole, each hath its peculiar excellency, and ſomething proper to every ones gift may be then ſeen, as well as in the face of man, by which in ſomethings they differ from all other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe more eminent extraordinary outlettings of the ſpirit do alſo witnes this truth, which at ſome ſpecial times when the churches neceſſity requireth it hath been moſt diſcernable, when the Lord ſendeth forth his ſervants, about a more then ordinary piece of work, either to doe, or ſuffer; when he is to plant the church in ſome place, where the goſpel will meet with much oppoſition, is it not then manifeſt how ſome more then ordinary power, and irreſiſtible efficacy doth accompany the truth, before which there is no ſtanding; the diſputer is then in his reaſoning confounded by ſomething above reaſon, the untoward, and rude are forced to ſtoop before the word, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they have to doe with power, and not with words; yea, theſe whom the Lord maketh uſe of, who were feeble, and weak as others, in that day are made as a brazen wall, &amp; defenced city.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo undenyable that now under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament there are Miniſters of the ſpirit, and not of a dead letter and empty ſound? That with the word, there goe along a miniſtration of power, and life, whence a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and authority attending the publick ordinances is oft ſo diſcernable, that even theſe vvho know not what the Spirit is are made to ſee ſomething therein vvhich doth dazle them vvith aſtonishment; vvhence is it that at ſometimes ſuch a beauty, and povver shineth forth vvith ordinances like a glance of the glory of God, even going before mens eyes, vvhich for the preſent hath made a vvonderful change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome very groſſe men and put them in an other temper, yea, forced them vvith fear to acknovvledge that ſurely God
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44187:57"/> is near in the aſſemblyes of his people<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and I would ask whence is it, the word giveth law to mens conſciences? should ſpeak with ſuch an authority, as maketh them all to shiver, that even the worſt of men are ſometime made to ſtand before the miniſtry of the word, like men ſtanding at the barr upon life, and death, before a judge whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they durſt not decline.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is very diſcernable what a great difference &amp; an other appearance, there is both on Miniſters, and Chriſtians at one time, from what they are at an other, in the diſcharge of duty, as if theſe were not the ſame perſons; vvhich ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not onely in the enlargement. and ſtreatning of their gift, but alſo in povver, and life; is it not ſeen, vvith vvhat liberty theſe doe ſometimes pray, are as a ship with a full gale before the vvind, that it is then eaſy to preach, vvhen at other times there is like a shut door, that even on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookers may perceive a ſenſible languishing and them ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in their very expreſſions, yea, as men rovving againſt a contrary wind, the vvord vvanting that ſavour &amp; rellish it hath had at other times, and this not through a natural indiſpoſition, or vvant of preparation, but that vvhich all vvho ever ſerved God in the ſpirit muſt confeſſe, hath moſt ſenſibly tryſted them vvhen they have thought themſelves at the greateſt advantage, for going about duety: O vvho can deny this evidence of the ſpirit, a thing in all ages ſo ſenſibly felt, yea, even obvious to the vvorſt of men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is alſo clear that vvhere ever the Lord hath had a church at ſome ſpecial turnes of her condition there have uſually been, ſome more ſolemn times of the ſpirit &amp; high ſpring-tydes of the goſpell, there was indeed marvellous flowing forth of the ſpirit of God after Chriſts aſcenſion, vvhich like a mighty current did carry all before it, at which time more ſucceſſe did follow one ſermon, then hath been by the miniſtry of many others in an age; this made the vvorld vvonder, as if ſome univerſal enchantment had fallen on men, vvhat that could bee, vvhich the more they ſought to bear dovvn, the more it increaſed, that made the rich chooſe poverty, and theſe vvho dwelt in palaces,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44187:58"/> take themſelves vvith chearfulnes to the dens. and caves of the earth; but beſides this, it is very manifeſt that in a large meaſure the ſpirit hath been let forth to the church in after ages, yea, there is no particular church vvhere the light hath shined but hath had it's ſpecial times, ſome ſolemn day of the powring out of the ſpirit, before the ſun vvent down; vvhich may be obſerved either at the firſt breaking up of the goſpel, or at ſome other remarkable time, and change of her condition; vvhence a great tack of ſouls to Chriſt hath follovved, in a day vvherein an effectual doore vvas opened, beſides the reaching of the conſcience, and ſtirring the affection of many others, under a common vvork of the ſpirit, which uſually goeth along vvith ſuch ſolemn times.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The going back of the tide, and viſible withdravving of the ſpirit from particular churches, vvhere it hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, in a large meaſure, been let forth, is a very convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvitnes to the truth of this promiſe; for it is clearly ſeen at vvhat a ſtand the goſpel is in theſe places vvhere it moſt eminently shined; that the land vvhich bloſſomed and vvas like a vvatered garden, hath been made as the heath in the vvildernes, and the ground from vvhence rain is vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dravven, and then that the miniſters of Chriſt, vvhoſe lot hath fallen in ſuch a time are put to very ſore vvork, to vvorke, as it vvere, vvith oares for vvant of vvind to caſt out the net all night, and catch nothing; a shut doore is upon them in the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, duty is made Lurthenſome becauſe the Lord is againſt them, there is an evident reſtraint upon the word, and its intercourſe is more with the ear, then with the conſciences of men, yea, any liberty they find is to execut a commiſſion of judgement, and to denounce the woe of the Goſpel. O, doth not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt withdrawing of the ſpirit witnes the outletting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that it is a certain, and real thing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Doe not the ſtirrings, and ſtrange convictions which even the worſt of men have ſometimes under the word, witnes a divine ſpirit, and power going along therewith, that which forceth an aſſent from their conſcience to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44187:58"/> truth, which otherwayes they hate, yea, maketh them for the time, wonder they should not have been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the wayes of God, yea it doth often put a thorn in the bed of their ſecurity; for indeed the word, and the light thereof doth torment theſe who dwell in the earth: And truely this is a marvellous thing, which winneth in uponm mens ſecret deſignes, and councels, doth reveal to them the moſt cloſs thoughts of their heart, which they are ſure mens eye could not reach, taketh them down through themſelves, and yet, that the world knoweth not whence it is, yea, are they not forced to confeſſe, what a great difference they find betwixt the word from the mouth of ſome, who are holy, and ſerious though held out in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſimplicity, then from others even of greater gifts, and accompanyed with more shew of eloquence, that ſurely the one, hath an other ſound, and relish, ſpeaketh more feelingly home to their heart, then the moſt polished di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of greateſt oratours.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. One witnes moe I shall here give to the truth of this promiſe, even theſe eminent examples of the grace of God, which in every age have shined, in the firmament of the Church, ſome in love, and zeal, ſome in patience, and humility, ſome in the ſtrong acts of faith, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44187:59"/>
                  <p>It is true, this promiſe hath its bounds, limits, and proviſions which should be taken along in the application thereof, we know the Covenant of God with particular Churches is conditional only, he promiſeth that he will be with them while they are with him, yea, it is oft ſeen, (and there is no jarr here with this promiſe) that a People profeſſing the Goſpel confederat with God, following duty, have even turned their back before the enemy, and in the holy providence of God, have for a time been given up to their fierce rage and violence; but it is alſo ſure that this promiſe, hath an accomplishment, and in the day of the Churches ſtrait the Lord hath oft appeared, by a ſtrong outſtretched hand for her help, his own arm brought ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his People, when they ſought to him; for God is known in her palaces for a refuge, yea, ſurely the Church might oft ſing that ſong on ſuch clear grounds as though with Iſrael shee had been ſtanding at the red ſea <hi>thy right hand, O Lord, is full of power, thy right hand hath dashed in pieces thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes;</hi> for what nation, or People is like this to whom he hath shewed ſuch marvellous things.</p>
                  <p>Now to shew forth the faithfulnes of God in this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I would offer ſome few things that are a moſt clear and undenyable witnes thereto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are fevv ages, but, vvee have ſome record of the churches condition, vvhich hold forth ſuch ſignal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing providences of God, in behalf of his oppreſſed church, and people, as may be a manifeſt ſeal to this truth; it is true ſome times have been more remarkable for ſuffering, times of judgement &amp; of a growing tryal wherein this truth hath not ſo clearly shined forth, yea that long night vvhich the church had under Antichriſt, might ſeem to call it in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but never the leſſe, if men take a ſerious look of the Lords vvay, and ſeries of providence in ages paſt, comparing one time vvith another, what the ſtraits, and moſt extream caſe of the church hath at laſt reſolved in, they will find cauſe to cry with aſtoniſhment, <hi>great deliverances giveth he to his people,</hi> yea, the Lord hath done gteat things for them. I am ſure, were a full record with that true account which might be given, of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44187:59"/> theſe more remarkable delivrances, that particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have met with, ſince the firſt planting of the Goſpel among them, wherein Gods very immediat hand for their help hath been diſcernable, it should <hi>non-plus</hi> the World, and greateſt Atheiſts anent the real outmaking of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The confeſſion even of the Churches enemyes hath oft witneſſed this truth that in purſuing their malice to trouble and undoe her, they have but undone themſelves; how tormenting diſappointments have cauſed their very flesh to pine away, and the cloſe and iſſue of their rage, forced this conviction from them at laſt, that the Church is a burthenſome ſtone, to be lifted up, a party with whom it is full of hazard to meddle; have not ſuch, been made to diſcern ſomething of a divine hand, ſo clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, blaſting their counſels, and moſt promiſing attempts, as if their eyes with Balaam had been opened to ſee the Angel in their way, yea in all ages it is known how the conſcience, even of the worſt hath oft bewrayed ſomething of a preſaging fear they have had of theſe whom they purſued with greateſt malice, and a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impreſſion they had of a praying people, and their prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This truth hath had the cleareſt witnes in times of the Churches greateſt ſtrait, and extremity, when difficulties have appeared inſuperable and an outgate in an ordinary way of providence moſt hopeleſſe, when viſible meanes have been withdrawn, all refuge failed, and none to help, that in ſuch a day the Lord hath been ſeen upon the mount and unexpectedly by very ſtrange midſes brought delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranee, to a broken almoſt ruined Church, even as it were betwixt the bridge, and the water; ſo that theſe who would have a clear view of the accomplishment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, may but turn back, on theſe more remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream exigences of the Churches condition, aod there have it, how oft a ſweet ſunshine hath followed the moſt dark, and cloudy times a raging ſtorm hath reſolved into a refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calm, yea, that with a further grouth of the Churches
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44187:60"/> tryal, and doubling of her burthen, her enlargement, and outgate hath broken up with ſo great and obvious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes therein that it was a convincing return of prayer, &amp; wreſtling, having further addition of ſome new and ſingular mercy therewith, yea, ſome eminent act of judgment upon her adverſaries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greateſt advantage, and victories which men have got over the Churches, and people of God can alſo bear witnes to this, that when the wicked have ſprung up like the graſſe, and the workers of iniquity ſeemed to flowrish, this very way hath the Lord taken to bring about a more full deliverance? Yea, on the other hand, hath it not been very obvious how the Churches gain hath been brought forth out of greateſt loſe, that theſe wounds which ſeemed moſt deadly, by the infinitly wiſe providence of God, have turned to her moſt effectual, and through cure; and mens unreaſonable violence, and rage againſt the Church hath oft had an evident tendency to bring about even that whereto it ſeemed moſt directly contrary, ſome further mercy, and deliverance, then could have been expected; as the Amorites refuſing Iſrael but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. This witnes the obſervation of the Church in all ages can bear to this promiſe, that deliverance hath oft ſprung up, and been brought to her hand from an airth, and by ſuch meanes, as none would have expected, by ſuch, as none but God could doe; a ſudden report and rumour; <hi>1 Sam. 23: ver. 27.</hi> meanes, that have been not only ſmall, and improbable but that looked directly contrary, as in bringing the Church out of Egypt, yea, ſometime by the wicked enſnared in the work of their own hands, is it not obvious, how the Lord hath tryſted mens privat intereſts to put them on, for befriending his Church and hath cauſed the earth to help the woman and raiſed up one oppreſſour to punish another, yea, often hath prepared carpenters, whence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44187:60"/> it was leaſt thought, to cut the horns of theſe who had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his people.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is this convincing witnes to the truth of ſuch a promiſe, that ſudden remarkable change, which may be oft diſcerned both on mens inward frame, and the outward face of the Church, when a time of mercy, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come; inſtruments raiſed of the Lord with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable elevation of their ſpirits to act, and doe exploits, the feeble then made ſtrong, and theſe who ſometime would have fainted, at an ordinary piece of ſervice dare with ſuch a gale of divine aſſiſtance run, as it were, through a troup, and overleap a wall' for indeed this may in all ages be obvious, how eaſy it is to move, in the day when the Lord moveth for his people, and ſtrengthneth the girdle of their loines, that it was not their bow, or ſword, which got them the victory, but the very finger of God, ſomething above the counſels of men, or ordinary meanes, which hath ſometimes been made clear as the noonday, ſo that even, at ſome diſtance, theſe who are wiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="3">3. We may oft ſee a very ſtrange tryſt, and concurrence of things, how inſtruments act to bring about the Lords end and advance his Churches intereſt, even while each

                  <p n="4">4. We have ſeen how in mens plotting the ruine of the Church there is oft an unſeen hand determining their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inclination to fall upon that very way, then which we would think nothing could have been more direct for her good and their own ruine, how an Hushai, hath been ſent in or ſome have been ſtirred up amongſt themſelv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (upon their own intereſt) to break the pernicious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and deſigns of others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We have alſo ſeen the perſonal quarrels of the Churches enemyes among themſelves, brought to ſuch an height, and to tryſt ſo ſeaſonably, that onlookers might clearly perceive that it hath been from the Lord, a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their rage, and violence againſt his poor oppreſſed People.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have ſeen the Churches enemies raiſed to a ſtrange height, all advantages favouring them, until their plot and mine hath been ripe for ſpringing, and lo, at that very choke, ſomething unexpected hath fallen out, which did turn their former ſucceſſe to their further ruine, yea, diſappoint all; this the World is ready to call ſome fata, and malevolent conjunction, which cannot be reſiſted, and what is this in effect, but the witneſs of mens conſcience to a divine hand?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Have we not ſeen ſome ſore dash, and overthrow in the Church bring forth her good, and a more full victory when viſible helpe and meanes have been taken out of the way, that ſomething above meanes might be ſeen in her condition, even in that day, when all hath been given for loſt, yea, truths loſeing the day upon the field, bring forth her triumph on the ſcaffold, and at the ſtake.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We have ſeen moſt deſpicable, and ordinary things, made ſubſervient for ſome great piece of the Lords work,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44187:62"/> a very ſmall thing made the firſt riſe of ſtrange revolutions, that remarkable changes, have been oft lying in the boſome of common providence; yea, truely we finde both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the obſervation of after ages witneſs that the Churches deliverance, and outgate, did almoſt never come that way, by ſuch a method, and meanes, as shee had moſt expected the ſame, and that Gods time of working, may be oft very contrary to our time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting?</p>
                  <p>I shall only add, is it not oft ſeen (which I am ſure all ages can witneſs,) how mens endeavours to darken the truth by errour, hath been an effectual meanes for its fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing?

                  <p>DOth concern theſe <hi>Scripture threatnings which are held forth in the word, with a reſpect to the viſible Church,</hi> and againſt a people profeſſing the Goſpel, that no priviledges they have above others shall exeem them from judgment, yea and from very ſad ſtrokes, he hath knowen them above the reſt of the World, he will contend with them moſt ſeverely becauſe of ſin; and ſuch particular evils as we find the Word threatneth.</p>
                  <p>I touched a little ſome Scripture-threatnings, in the preceeding argument as concerned Chriſtians in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44187:63"/> experience; what I here intend is to point at this truth, as it is written in the providences, and judgments of every time to mens obſervation, how judgments from the Lord, which point, as with the finger, at the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of that time, do reach a land, and particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, according to the threatnings of the word; this is indeed manifeſt, that the greateſt promiſes made to a people, we find backed with ſaddeſt threatnings, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find, the greateſt monuments of wrath have uſually been ſet up, where ſometimes the largeſt offers of the Goſpel were, yea, that the anger of the Lord may draw ſo deep againſt a people profeſſing his name, as to make their land deſolate, and the high wayes thereof mourn; for in this precinct of the Church doth both judgement and mercy moſt eminently shine forth, and the Lords way there, doth differ from that he hath with any other people.</p>
                  <p>Now to clear this grave truth a litle, how theſe threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the word, againſt a nation, and people becauſe of ſin are alſo verifyed, in their judgements, I shall touch a few inſtances, that are moſt known, and obvious, where we may lay the word, and obſervation of the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſee how they anſwer one the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt we find the <hi>Threatnings of the word do point at the time of a peoples judgement, 1 Theſ. 2, ver. 16. Rev. 14: ver. 15, 18.</hi> That when they fill up the meaſure of their ſin, and their cup is full, the Lord will not then defer the execution; until the cup of the Amorites was full he did let them alone; and we find an anſwer deferred to the cry of the ſouls under the altar, for avenging their blood on Antichriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that accurſed party had yet more to do againſt the Church, and the Saints more to ſuffer under their hand.</p>
                  <p>Now to witneſs the accomplishment of this; let us but conſider what in all times may be obſerved. Firſt that there is an ordinary grouth, and height of ſin, which a land com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to before deſtruction, ſome national, and univerſal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44187:63"/> ſpreading thereof, prodigious outbreakings, the utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of reproof, which shew that a peoples caſe, muſt then be on ſome turn, yea, that ſtrange, and unuſuall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, uſeth to go before, ſome ſtrange ſtroke. 2. Before judgement come, is it not ſeen, how the ſin of a people hath become ſo daring, that it hath had a loud cry; yea, their caſe hath been ſuch as did juſtify the Lords procedure againſt them, even in the conſcience of all lookers, that he did it not without much cauſe? 3. Is it not eaſy for ſuch as are wiſe to know the times, to ſee night coming on a land, when ſin is at ſome dreadful height, by conſidering the word, and the Lords uſual way with a people in ſuch a caſe? Yea, hath there not then been ſome ſpecial forwarnings, a more then ordinary impreſſion of judgement upon the ſpirits of the godly? the hiding of many of them in the grave, which, as threatning preſages, hath shewed the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proache of a ſtroke. 4. There doth not uſually want even ſome Noah, or Jonas, the Miniſters of God ſent forth to threaten, who as watchmen upon the wall are diſcerning hazard at diſtance, yea, with an obſervable preſſure then upon their ſpirit; and a more then ordinary aggreement amongſt themſelves to cry out, and give the people warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the time of judgement hath been drawing near.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is clear, <hi>there are ſome ſpecial evils, and ſins of a time, which we find the word moſt dreadfully doth threaten,</hi> yea in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way it doth put a mark upon them that though the Lord should paſſe by many infirmities in a Church, and people profeſſing his name; yet, for ſuch, and such ſins as we find, in <hi>Amos 1: ver.</hi> 2. he will not turn away the punishment thereof, but hath ſolemnly declared, by his truth and faithfulnes, that theſe shall not paſſe without ſome viſible mark, even before the world, of his anger, now in this the Scripture is clear, and lets us see there are ſome ſins more particularly threatned, ſome land deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins that have as it were the marke ſet on them, which doe eſpecially provoke the holy indignation, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of God; ſuch as <hi>idolatry,</hi> corrupting the Worship of God;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44187:64"/> 
                     <hi>Perjury, and Covenant-breaking,</hi> shall they break my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and eſcape ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek. 17: ver.</hi> 15. alſo departing from God, and his way, for this the land shall be deſolat as in <hi>Ierem. 9: ver.</hi> 12, 13. yea blood guiltines which the earth shall not cover, and for which the sword shall not depart, even from the houſe &amp; family of David, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12: 10.</p>
                  <p>Now to evidence the accomplishment hereof I shall point at ſomethings moſt obvious to the obſervation of every time, how terribly the Lord uſeth to plead for ſuch things, and by ſome exemplary ſtroke, and judgement point them out, as we find them particularly ſet by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the word, and threatnings thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt how in theſe ſins, thus marked, men may ſee how their judgements uſe not wholly to be deferred to another world, but though much is oft paſſed here, and laid over to that laſt, and great judgement, yet, upon ſuch ſins the Lord hath put ſome mark of his diſpleaſure, even in this life. 2. That for theſe he uſeth to contend, before the ſun, and in the view of men: his judgements are indeed oft ſecret, and doe conſume as a moth, but upon ſuch ſins we may frequently ſee, ſome publick, and viſible ſtroke is made to follow that the world cannot paſſe without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. 3. That the Lord alſo uſeth to be a very ſwift wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt ſuch evils, for as we find the oppreſſion of the Church hath a lowd cry, and the blood of the ſaints <hi>a how long?</hi> it is alſo ſeen theſe forementioned ſins, do much haſten judgement, ſo as ſeldome that generation paſſeth away without ſome witneſs thereto; it is rarely found that ſome great revolt of a people from God, and breaking Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, doth ly long over unpunished, nor doth the hoary head of the violent. and bloody man go oft to the grave in peace. 4. That theſe ſins uſe to be followed with ſome very dreadful, and eminent ſtroke, they have made the land deſolat, their cityes ſometime waſt, and a ruinous heap, yea, houſes great, and fair to be without inhabitans; ſo as men have with aſtonishment enquired, why is all this comed to paſſe; and it was eaſy to anſwer,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44187:64"/> even for ſuch, and ſuch evils hath the Lord done this, according to his word. 5. That a divine hand uſeth to be moſt diſcernable in the punishments of ſuch ſins becauſe of a very clear reſemblance betwixt them, and the ſtroke, which hath forced their own conſcience, as well as of onlookers to confeſſe the Righteouſnes of God therein. 6. That the Lord will put ſome mark of his anger on the choiſeſt of his ſervants for any acceſſion to ſuch ſins, theſe to whom he hath given their ſoul for a prey, have yet got a ſore outward ſtroke, upon ſuch an account, which hath followed them to the grave; for this the ſword shall not depart from Davids houſe: Idolatry rent the Kingdome from the poſterity of Salomon. Jonas shall not eſcape for his rebellion, yea, God was wroth with Moſes, and no intreaty shall hinder his dying in the wildernes. I may adde, hath not the Lords controverſy on this ground even reached their poſterity. which may shew that theſe threatnings are ſad earneſt, and ſuch ſins are not more particularly pointed at in the word, then they have been in after ages made exemplary in judgement.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A peoples lukwarmeneſſe their ſlighting of the goſpel,</hi> and not receiving the love of the truth, we find ſadly threatned in the word, <hi>Rev. 3: ver. 15, 16. 2 Theſs. 2: ver.</hi> 10, 11. and truely we muſt ſay, they have not fallen to the ground in any age without an accomplishment, as frequent obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can witneſs. Firſt how a peoples entring upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious way, their purſuing a form of reformation, and not through for God therein, but on carnal grounds, hath thus put them in a worſe condition then before, for truely mens hypocriſy, in going about a good work doth threaten more, then the performance thereof doth promiſe. Jehu got a temporal reward but his poſterity muſt at length reckon for all the blood of Jezreel. 2. That no people uſe to be furder from getting good of the goſpel then ſuch who have been under moſt clear, and greateſt convictions, ſo as it is found, there is oft more acceſſe to gain amongſt the ſavages, then theſe who have ſit their day
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44187:65"/> while the tide did flow, yea, miniſters have found moſt diſcouragement to labour in theſe parts where the word hath been long preached with power. 3. It is ſeen, how light not improved will turn a People more groſſe, and is uſually followed with ſome remarkable grouth in ſin, that the more the word doth put a reſtraint on mens corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more it rageth; ſo as it may be obſerved what a very black dy, and collour, the powerful preaching of the Goſpel hath put upon a People, as a viſible mark of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſuch who profit not thereby. 4. Is it notſeen how mens formality in the matters of God hath been oft punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even with the taking away of the forme? Yea, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome errour, and deluſion doth want a harveſt amongſt a People who receive not the truth in love. 5. Hath not ſlighting of the Goſpel been at laſt followed with ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reſtraint, and inhibition, both upon the ordinances, and diſpenſers thereof, a judicial withdrawing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as to the work of converſion, and conviction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord doth plainly ceaſe to be a reprover to ſuch, yea, even ſaith, bind up the Law, and ſeal the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Word doth alſo threaten carnal Security</hi> (a diſeaſe whereof the Church is oft in great hazard) yea, we find it holds forth a certain connexion betwixt ſpiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon a People, and ſome outward ſtrokes to follow thereon that theſe who are under that firſt woe, and plague upon their ſpirits, are then near, to ſome judgement upon their perſons, and may expect a sharp wakening; in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they shall not underſtand, &amp;c. but the cloſe is, until the cities be conſumd without inhabitants, and there be an utter deſolation, yea, we find judgement doth begin as a moth in that 5. of Hos. but in the 14. ver. it doth turn at laſt to be a lyon. We may truely ſay the fulfilling of this hath in all ages of the Church been obvious. 1. That as the firſt part of the Churches deliverance is uſually ſpiritual, ſo it is found the firſt ſtep of judgement, and the execution thereof againſt a People, hath been upon their ſpirits; that ſerious diſcerners of the time might know that the night
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44187:65"/> was faſt coming on, and ſome ſad outward ſtroke on a land, by the abounding of ſpiritual judgements. 2. It is clear themoſt dreadful ſtrokes that ever come on a particular Church, doe uſually find it in ſuch a caſe, judicially hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and under many warnings plagued with ſecurity; thus did the floud finde the old World, and before that deſolating ſtroke on Jeruſalem by the Romans, were not the Jewes in ſuch a caſe. Salvain can tell how it was with the African Churches, before that dreadful inundation of the Gothes, and Vandals, yea, the Churches records in all ages doe witneſs that before any ſad ſtroke or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came upon a People, a deep ſleep, and lethargie, hath been previous thereto; gray haires might have been ſeen upon them, and the Word, doth even shew that this will be the laſt diſeaſe whereof the Church shall be ſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great day of the Lord. 3. It is alſo ſeen how ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judgements when they grow upon a people, make great diſpatch, and do quickly ripen, for ſome further ſtroke, that when men have run down their conſcience and are paſt reproof of the word, going on from evil to worſe, the caſe cometh then to be clear, and ready for the finall diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the proceſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The word doth denounce woe againſt the troublers of the Church,</hi> and theſe who are her perſecutors, that the Lord shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence tribulation to ſuch, and plead with her oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the accomplishment whereof hath been truely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, yea to the obſervation even of the world. <hi>Iſ. 10: 5. 2 Theſs: 1: ver. 6.</hi> 1. That eminent oppreſſours of the Church have ſeldome gone out of the World, without ſome remark of divine anger upon them; ſurely if there were a record of ſuch inſtances that in every age hath been conſpicuous, men should be forced to ſee and ſay that the moſt noted enemyes, and perſecutors of the ſaints have been alſo the moſt convincing and noted examples of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the time. 2. That the Churches ſuffering uſeth to go before a day of vengeance on the inſtruments thereof; we find Jehu got an outward reward for execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng the judgement of God on his enemyes; but as for theſe men
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44187:66"/> who have been the rod of the Church it hath been ſeen that they have not long wanted ſome ſcourge as ſore upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they have been to his People, and that at laſt theſe have payed dear-for their ſervice. 3. We may ſee how this alſo doth help to finish the contraverſy of God, with men: and their houſes, that for this he hath taken many away in the midſt of their dayes, and made them ceaſe to be, who would not ceaſe to trouble the Church, while they had a being; yea that He hath taken them in his own hand, whom men could not reach, and made their down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting in the midſt of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Doth not the Scripture threaten carnal confidence,</hi> in a People, the putting of their truſt in man or in any outward inſtruments, <hi>Ier. 17: ver. 5, 6.

There is a vive portraicture of providence in the affaires of the Church held forth in that viſion which Ezekiel had of the wheeles at the river Chebar, whoſe miſterious motions, and turnings ſo croſs one to the other, without any diſcord therein, as to the end, to which they were directed, doth witnes the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and wiſe conduct of providence: the Lords work about his Church, is a moſt shadowed, and elaborat piece, which men cannotſee, before their eye, as they ſee behind upon a review, while ordinary cauſes do oft vary in their operation, yea, goe out of the common road, yet the Scripture will make this very plain. 2. Was not Nehemiah, Ezra, and Zerobabel at their work, and duty, and had an expreſſe call, for building of the temple, yet, how great, and frequent interruptious did they find, ſometimes environed with difficulties, <hi>Zach. 4: ver. 7.

We find a ſpecial reformation ſet on foot, by Hezekiah with a ſolemn Covenant, by the Princes, Prieſts, and body of the People, with a ſetting up of the pure Worship, and ordinances of God, but lo a sharp ſtorm is ſoon after, by Sennacherib, yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That a ſad overclouding, and darknes should come on a land after most ſpecial manifeſtation of the power and glory of God therein,</hi> and that a time of the Goſpel with much light should be ſo neer a forerunner of wrath, and judgement, would ſeem a ſtrange piece of providence, and cauſe a ſerious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry hovv ſuch eminent appearances of God for a people, ſuch great confirmations, obſervable ſucceſs for a time, vvith many ſignal encouragements, should all ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in a deſolating ſtroke, and ruine? This may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in that proteſtant vvar in France vvhere inſtruments vvere remarkably raiſed, fitted of the Lord for the ſervice of that time, had much of his preſence, and countenance, yet, to reſolve thus in a bloody maſſacre; likevvayes theſe confederat German Princes, <hi>Saxony, and Landgrave of Heſse,</hi> Men eminent for piety, caried forth vvith much zeal for God, for defence of the truth, yea, in the beginning of that vvar having many promiſing encouragements, yet, remarkably deſerted of the Lord vvith very ſad-like conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences follovving the ſame. Let us conſider alſo the late Bohemian vvar, ſtated upon neceſſary defence of religion and liberty, and at firſt attended with ſome ſmiling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, should reſolve into ſo great a deſolation, and ruine: yea, the Church of Ireland, O, what a dreadful maſſacre of the proteſtants there, did quickly follow one of the moſt ſolemn times of the power of God and outpowring of the ſpirit that we ever heard of, ſince the dayes of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44187:69"/> I confeſſe this may have a ſtrange aſpect, and is a part of the marvellous wayes of the Lord, but when we take it in to the word, we will find there is no jar, or diſcord here, for. 1. It might ſeem as ſtrange, and aſtonishing what Baruch got from the Lord in anſwer to his compliant, <hi>Ierem. 45.</hi> that he would pluck up what he had planted, and caſt down that which he had built, for a work to be thus throwen down, where the Lord had once ſo eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, &amp; given his People many confirmations might then occaſion great thoughts of heart, yet the unſpotted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God, and his truth was apparent therein; yea, after that diſcourſe, and all theſe large promiſe, which Chriſt gave his diſciples in that ſixteenth of Iohn, we find all is shut up with that, the houre is comming; and now is, that ye shall be ſcattered. 2. What ſtrange providences did tryſt the Church in the wildernes, ſometime brought back to the red ſea, tryed with hunger, and nakedneſſe, conſumed with various ſtrokes, and many yeares wandring until moſt of that generation, who came out of Egypt filled their graves in the journey, and yet this was after moſt eminent confirmations, and as clear ſinges of Gods preſence as ever a People had. 3. We find a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation moſt zealouſly proſecute by Ioſias, which looked like the renewed eſpouſales of that land with God, by a ſolemn Covenant, yet, quickly after night came on that land with a long captivity, and Joſias did fall by the ſword. 4. Was there nor a bright ſun-blink, &amp; flowrish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plantation of the Goſpel in Judea a little before the deſolation of that land by the Romans, yea, we will find it clear from the word that times of much light, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation doe much ſooner ripen for a ſtroke then any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er times. 5 It is very manifeſt that particular Churches have their day where the Goſpel hath its appointed work, and their ſtroke at laſt may reach the length of removing the candleſtick, I truely think that ſad inſtance of Bohemia's caſe, may have this obſervable in it, that it had longer day, and enjoyment of the light even from the times of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ierom of Pragus</hi> which was neer an 100 years before there was any day break on other parts, ſo that vve

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Is it not uſually ſeen when judgement cometh on a land, that the Godly get the first ſtroke?</hi> but let us alſo conſider this in the word, where it is clear, 1. That judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God, and the green tree; and that the Churches trouble, and perſecution is a forerunner of vengeance on her adverſaries, do we not find, there is a cup of tryall which uſeth to go before, that cup of the judgement of God? And O the laſt is of a ſtrong compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, for the wine is red and mixed, and the dreg very thick which is reſerved for the troublers of the Church, and for ſuch who are at eaſe in a day of her grief, and truely they have the advantage that drink firſt, <hi>Bleſt are they whom thou chaſteneſt, &amp;c.

That there is a proſerity which tendeth to deſtruction, <hi>Prov. 1: ver. 32.</hi> the tabernacles of the robbers proſper, <hi>Iob 12: ver. 6.</hi> and they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God are ſecure, into whoſe hands he bringeth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, but they doe not ſee that wickednes is its own pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and how it is a dreadful ſtroke to thrive in an ill courſe. Was not the Church shaken with ſuch a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Mal. 3: ver. 15.</hi> yea, tempted to call the proud happy, but in the ver. 18. they were taught from further obſervation to diſcern, and to put a difference between the righteous, and the wicked. 2. Doe we not find that even the ſignes, and predictions of falſe Prophets in favours of a ſinful way may come to paſſe, <hi>Deut. 13: ver. 1, 2.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Church is there warned, and Gods intent in the ſame cleared, that it is for the tryal of his People, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they will love, and fear the Lord, and cleave to his way, when providence would ſeem to shine on a crooked path. 3. Did not ſucceſſe for a time attend Abſolom? Iſrael as one man went after him, yea, the friends and counſellours of David; a fair wind did alſo favour Haman in his eſſay to ruin the Church. Jeremy is almoſt shaken with this, <hi>yea they have taken root, yea, they grow, and bring forth fruit,</hi> but is not this at laſt uſually found an ominous weather-gall before a ſtorm? though the bruitish man knoweth not, nor fooles lay it to heart for what the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doth oft ſpring, and flowrish; I would add Iſraels fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Benjamin, it was an aſtonishing like providence; and Habacuck was put to a ſtand with ſuch a thing, why the Lord lookt on, while the wicked devoured the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; Yea, Joshua, was to cry out in an amazement. O Lord what shall I ſay, when Iſrael turneth their back before their enemyes? but we have alſo the Lords intent therein witneſſed by his word, that this is to humble, and prove his People, that he may doe them good in the latter end, and thus he beateth them off from all carnal grounds of confidence, he woundeth them to a cure, that by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44187:70"/> bringiug them low, he may raiſe, and fit them for a further mercy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>What great diſappointments hath the Church met with,</hi> when outward grounds of confidence, and ordinary meanes have been moſt promiſing, as it is a thing moſt true, ſo it may ſeem ſtrange at the firſt look, but let us bring it to the word and the caſe will be there anſwered. <hi>Deut. 32. Why should one chaſe a thouſand, but becauſe their rock hath ſold them,</hi> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore their ſtrength is gone with the Lords departing from them, for, when a time of judgement is come, even the mighty then find not their hands, counſel faileth to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ordinary means bring not forth their wonted effects, which Solomon sheweth and after ages have oft ſeen, the race not ever to the ſwift nor the battel to the ſtrong, it is alſo clear from the word, how threatning a condition that is, for the People of God to be much caried out after meanes, or lifted up therewith, Iſ. 30. they will ride on horſes, and this shall be their punishment, but on the other hand the Lords way, in bringing forth his greateſt vvorks hath not been by might, and povver, but oft by meanes moſt improbable, and unexpected.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>The long continuance of a heavy afflisting rod on the Church, without the appearance of an outgate,</hi> or any return to much vvreſtling, and prayer on that account, may ſeem a ſtrange ſtep in Gods vvay, vvith his People. But the vvord vvill anſwer us in ſuch a caſe where it is clear. 1. That there are no bounds in the Scripture ſet to the continuance of a tryal, it doth not tell how long a sharp ſtorm may ly on, either as to the Church, or any particular Chriſtian; for it is a piece of the Lords ſecret counſel, but not of that which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is enough that we know from it that men cannot make the Churches ſuffering longer, then Gods time. 2. It was a long terme that of Iſraels tryal in Egypt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the captivity, three hundred and ninty dayes muſt the Church ly on her left ſide. O how many a ſad day, and weariſome night was there in that word, 70 weekes are determined upon thy people, and city Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. 3.

It is alſo clear that there are many prayers before the throne, the return whereof is ſuſpended, and an anſwer to Chriſtians, in their particular, until that time when God shall build up Zion, and then the prayer of the deſtitute shall be remembred even as to Chriſtians privat enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Church shall be raiſed up. 5. We know the Churches enemyes muſt have time to ripen, and it is not a ſtorm of a few dayes, that will purge away the filth of the Daughter of Zion, too ſoon letting out of a ſore, may cauſe it undercot, and gather new matter, and truely the word can reſolve us in this, that one minut ſooner, then Gods time would not be his peoples mercy.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is oft ſeen <hi>when there is ſome remarkable work of God on foott in a land, and ſome great outpowring of the ſpirit, how Sathan ſetteth up ſome uſual counterfeit thereof,</hi> and bringeth forth ſomething of his work in ſuch a time with a very ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the ſame; thus, with the preaching of the freedome of grace, and a clear diſcovery of that truth, did Libertiniſme under a very ſpecious pretext, ſpring up. Thus we find the Anabaptiſt, and Antinomian party, ſet up in Germany, to run down a Church-reformation under the shew of a more pure, and ſpiritual way; and of late did not Familiſme in England, and new England under pretext of a more ſpiritual diſpenſation caſt off the very letter of the Scripture, turning it over in an Allegory, and in behalf of the liberty of propheſying, cry down a ſtanding miniſtry; but though this may ſeem ſtrange, yet, the Scripture is very clear concerning it. 1. That even Sathan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of light, and in no shape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

That the moſt dreadful errours, and a falſe way will oft come near to the choiſeſt exerciſes of the ſaints, and have ſuch a reſemblance to the ſame, that if it were poſſible the very elect should be deceived. 3. Was there not a Simon Magus with falſe miracles ſet up over againſt the Apoſtles, and when the time of the Meſſias drew near, did not then a Theudas, and Judas of Galilee, break forth to amuſe the people? We find alſo an altar from Damaſcus, ſet up beſide that which was shewed to Moſes the Servant of the Lord in the mount, yea, when Moſes, and Aaron was giving Pharaoh a ſign, &amp; did shew forth the marvellous power of God then did the Magicians caſt doun their rod alſo to counterfeit the ſame, by which the heart of Pharaoh was hardned.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>The abounding ſo much of errour, and hereſie, now in the times of the goſpel,</hi> with that ſwift grouth thereof, which is oft ſeen where the light moſt clearly shineth, would ſeem ſtrange, yea, is a thing whereat many are ready to ſtumble, and thus to challenge the way of God. But is not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this clearly verifyed ſo that this piece of providence, which is ſo shaking to many, if we take the word along with it might be a very convincing confirmation to us of the ſame, for. 1. We find the Apoſtles, yea, Chriſt himſelf hath given expreſſe vvarning thereof, that this should be one of the ſpecial, and greateſt tryals of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, vvhereof the Old Teſtament vve find doth litle mention, that tryal not concerning the Church then ſo much, as theſe after-times under the Meſſias Kingdome: wherein the event, may be clearly ſeen, to anſvver theſe predictions, vvhich are ſo frequent thereof in the Nevv Teſtament. 2. Doth not the event alſo anſvver the vvord as to that particular vvay, and method, hovv errour should be propagated, which is there clearly foretold, by ſubtil undermining, under the pretext of liberty with plauſible inſinuations, ſo that we muſt ſay not only the matter, but with all theſe diſcernable tokens, even upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the word is made out. 3. Doe we not find this should be judgement on men who receive not the love of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44187:72"/> the truth, and that after flourishing times of the Church, when he who rideth on the white horſe is gone forth, the black horſe, and his rider doth quickly follow, and truely it is ſeen that in the time of hotteſt perſecution, the Church hath not been ſo much troubled with this adverſary, as when she did begin to get reſt, and moſt of outward liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor yet ſo at the firſt breaking up of the Goſpel, as after ſome time of its continuance. 4. Doth not the event like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thus anſwer the word, that in the breaking out of hereſy in the Church, a ſpirit of errour, the dephts and mighty working of Satan should be ſeen, which I am ſure is undenyable, how manifeſt the interpoſing of theſe powers of darknes is therein, if we conſider, 1. Its mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous diſpatch, and grouth like a plague, and the arrow that flieth by day. 2. With what a diſcernable fury, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence men are thus driven, as with an impetuous current, yea, oft a change on their very natural temper is ſeen moſt evidently. 3. Theſe monſtrous, and horrid things, which are oft brought forth, may shew whoſe hand is in ſuch a birth. 4. That uſual tendency that at laſt errour hath to looſneſs in practice, which as it poiſoneth the ſpring, and corrupteth the leading faculty the judgement, ſo we ſee, it moveth towards the vital ſpirits and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the converſation; and thus the leproſy in the head, breaketh forth in blaines through the whole body. 5. And doe we not ſee how many groſſe, and profane have been carried with this ſpate, how few get leave to ſtand, but are ſtill carryed from one ſtep to another, and it is clear the world did never put out its rage ſo much againſt that way, as it hath done againſt the truth, except when ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intereſt, maketh it a quarrel.</p>

But is not the word verified herein, what great ſtirs, and trouble did tryſt the the Church after great light in powring out of the ſpirit, <hi>Ioell 2: ver. 29.</hi> we may there likewayes ſee, how this giveth the World an Alarum, maketh the Kings, and

But let us weight it in that ballance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we will find. 1. That ſuch hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Saints, the Lords wounding them vvith the vvound of a cruel one; vvhat a ſtrange query is that in <hi>Lament. 2: ver. 20. Behold, and conſider, to whom thou haſt done this shall the women eat the fruit of their womb, shall the Prieſt and Prophet be ſlain the Sanctuary of the Lord,</hi> yea, did it not even to Solomon ſeem ſtrange, <hi>Eccleſ. 8: ver.</hi> 14. that there are juſt men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked. 2. It looked like ſome ſtrange ſtroke, vvhich forced David to this complaint, my enemies caſt iniquity on me, and ſay an evil diſeaſe, or as the original readeth it, a thing of Belial cleaveth to him; vve find lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias fell by the ſvvord; Eli, vvith one ſtroke hath his ſons killed, his Daughter in lavv dying, and himſelf falling from his ſeat, and breaking his neck; yea, Aaron hath both his ſons killed before his eyes, by an immediat ſtroke from the Lord. 3. The vvord doth alſo shevv, there is no jar betvvixt this, and the tenor of the Covenant vvhich God hath made vvith his people, to punish their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with rods, yea, ſometimes by a ſtrange rod, while he taketh not his loving kindneſſe from them, and doe we not find that a cleanly tryal, may tryſt the ſaints vvhich the vvorld vvould think a dreadful judgement, for, great ſufferings may be ordered of the Lord, to give ſome great examples thereby, vve have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>The groſs falling of theſe who have ſometimes shined with much luſtre in the Church</hi> may be aſtonishing, but here alſo, vve may ſee the ſcripture made out, for it is clear. Firſt that fevv inſtances of the moſt eminent of the Saints, vve have on Scripture record, but there is ſome particular ſpot, and blemish alſo noted, a Noah, Lot, Moſes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, yea, under the Nevv Teſtament that great Apoſtle,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44187:73"/> whoſe denyall of his maſter is ſet forth, to shew how far ſome may fall whom grace will again reſtore, and make up. 2. It is there clear, that ſome of underſtanding doe fall for a judgement to others, that ſuch who will ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe prejudice at the way of God is their choice, may thus further fall, and be broken. 3. The bleſt meaning, and intent hereof we may there alſo read to Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum men to watchfulnes, that ſuch who ſtand may take heed leſt they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="14">14. I would adde this, <hi>The contingency of events,</hi> that we ſee many things in ſuch a caſual way fall out in the world, as if by chance only without the rational conduct of a providence (which doth infallably direct things to a certain end,) this might at the firſt look, put men to a ſtand, yea, would ſeem to give Atheiſts ſome shadow to ſay, how doth God ſee or doth the God of Jacob regard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But upon a more ſerious enquiry, ſetting the word over againſt it, O what a ſweet exerciſe should it be to conſider. 1. That though the providence of God in things here beneath moveth ſutably to the nature of inferiour cauſes, whither neceſſary, free, or contingent, not violenting them, or otherwayes making uſe of them, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their nature, ſo that though the event be neceſſary, and infallible, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a reſpect to the firſt cauſe, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined counſel of God, it is never the leſſe contingent in reſpect of its neareſt cauſe; yet, this alſo on the other hand is clear, how the ſmalleſt, and moſt caſual motions doe certainly fall under that comprehenſive reach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that even a ſparrow falleth not to the ground by gueſſe. Rebeccah cometh not with her pitcher to the well nor Ruth to glean in Boaz field at an adventure, but in theſe the providence of God muſt reach its end, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſcary. 2. That theſe things which to us would ſeem moſt caſual we oft ſee in their tendency, and product, have been intended by the Lord, as a ſpecial mean for the promoting of his glory wherein ſuch a wonderful tryſt,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44187:74"/> and uniting of things in themſelves moſt remote for that end may be truely diſcerned, that if prejudice do not shut mens eyes, they muſt confeſſe this can be no blind chance, but ſome higher counſel, and conduct of the ſame; what would look more contingent then that Ahaſuerus was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to ſleep and could have no reſt in the night, or that a reflexion of the ſun upon the waters should make them appear as blood to the Children of Moab? But we ſee what great things the Lord, is thus bringing about. 3. Is it not oft manifeſt, how not the ſmalleſt caſuality, or circumſtance providence doth loſſe, without ſome improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof? yea, that it guideth the ſtroke of mans ſword in the battel, and directeth the bullet to its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mark, and it doth evidently check the ſtarres and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol that fatal neceſſity, which we are ready to fear may or will follow their aſpect, and it doth even determine theſe which in themſelves are moſt free, and abſolute, the heart, and wil of man; muſt not the crowing of the cock, the foldiers dividing of Chriſts garments fall out for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the Scripture, and though it was at a venture that that man drew the bow which ſent Ahab to his grave, yet, it was no chance did direct the arrow between the very joynts of his armour. 4. Amidſt the various emergents, and hazards of mens life, may not experience tell that ſurely things contingent are not abandoned to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but there is a providence which doth number our haires, without which they cannot fall to the ground. O how aſtonishing may it be to think hovv ſurprizing hazards have been oft obviated? by vvhat unexpected meanes men have been delivered from violent aſſaults, hovv help unlooked for hath even tryſted at a choke, and an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea, vvhile their foot vvas ſlipping even betvvixt their falling, and fall, they have been tryſted vvith ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable caſt of mercy. 5.

               <head>THE THIRD ARGUMENT</head>
               <p>FOr the Scriptures accomplishment is this, that not only the Chriſtians experience, and obſervation of the Cnnrch beareth witneſs thereto, but it is alſo <hi>a truth which even to the view, and conviction of the World, may be demonſtrat,</hi> from whom it doth oft force a teſtimony, yea, in every age the worſt of men have been forced to acknowledge, and ſo it muſt be a thing very evident. But the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scripture can be thus witneſſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is true theſe ſweet, and ſenſible enjoyments which the Saints have of this truth, the World cannot reach; but it is alſo ſure, that in every age, the works of the Lord, and ſome more notour convincing providences, both of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mercy doe ſolemnly invite men, to obſerve the accomplishment of the word therein; yea, no time hath wanted ſomething of a publick vvitneſſe, from ungodly men even greateſt mockers of Religion, vvho under that conſtraining povver of conſcience at death, or in ſome day of their ſtrait, have been forced to ſeal the truth by a very open confeſſion of the righteouſnes of God tovvards them, and this is indeed the Lords bleſſed deſign in making his vvorks ſometime ſo conſpicuous, that they may not only confirm the faith of his people, but render Atheiſm inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, that the glory of his faithfulnes, as vvell as of his povver, and vviſdome, may shine forth before the ſons of men. I confeſſe vve may vvonder, vvhy the World look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo litle upon this, and hovv the conviction of ſo great a truth, vvhich they cannot shun, doth not more preſſe them; but the Holy Ghoſt doth fully reſolve this, the brutish
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44187:75"/> man knovveth not, neither do fooles lay to heart, hovv the Scripture taketh place; and that the flovvrishing of vvicked men, is but in judgement for their further ruine.</p>
               <p>To proſecut this argument a litle, there are ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial truths I vvould inſtance, vvherein the faithfulnes of God in fulfilling his vvord may be ſeen, by the World, yea, is obvious to the moſt ordinary obſervers; and though they be but a fevv, vvhich I shall here touch, yet I muſt ſay, they are ſuch concerning truths, and have ſo neer a reference to the foundation of our faith, that men cannot acknovvledge the ſame, but muſt alſo confeſſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Divinity, and that there is a truth, and reality in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and in Chriſtian Religion; truely I may here vvith ſome confidence challenge the greateſt Atheiſts, yea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale them to their conſcience, and ſerious thoughts, if in theſe following inſtances, (though but a litle of what might be ſaid on ſuch a ſubject,) the truth, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Scripture be not very manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST.</hi> I shall firſt hold forth this truth that <hi>man is ſurely fallen from that excellent estate wherein once he was formed, Rom. 5: ver.</hi> 18. 19. and now is not that which he was at the beginning; a truth ſo clear, that we may ſay even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcovery of the word might be eaſy for any ſerious onlooker, to diſcern the ſame, did not even heathens have ſome glance at this? The evidence whereof they could not altogether shun.</p>
               <p>It is true the cauſe, and original of this dreadful conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how ſin entered into the World, how it is derived to the whole race of man, by imputation, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion, how that poiſon is carried from the fountain to the ciſtern, the Scriptnre doth only diſcover; but this I am ſure may be obvious to all, that poor man is thus ſick, and diſeaſed, and now beareth the marks of ſuch a fall, and ruine, as we read of in the word. I confeſſe it is ſtrange, that when this is ſo very convincing, and manifeſt, it should not force men to ſome more ſerious enquiry,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44187:75"/> whence ſuch a thing is, or if there can be a recovery of ſo ſad, and deſperat like caſe, but to clear this a litle, I would offer theſe three things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is ſome remainder of that excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, which may yet appear among its ruines, ſome print, and appearance (though dark) of that primitive luſtte and beauty, ſome draughts wich ſin hath not wholly worn out, that may clearly tell what man once was, and point out his former excellency, that he hath been an other wight, of whom Abſaloms character might be truely ſaid, without all blemish from the head to the foot. For we ſee the deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a Deity ſtill rooted in men, even among the moſt wilde, and ſavage which no invention can utterly raze, we ſee ſome common principles of reaſon that are imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt rude, and ignorant, ſome innate notions, and Ideas which the ſoul hath of good, and evil, among all, and in every place of the earth; likewiſe theſe natural truths <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which we may ſee are no wayes impreſt on the ſoul from any objects of ſenſe, but ſuch whereto men by an unavoidable neceſſity are forced to aſſent, and beſides, what meaneth the witneſs of the conſcience, and authority thereof in every man, which they cannot poſſibly decline? O doe not theſe vvitneſs that from ſome great height poor man hath fallen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth not the preſent appearance of mans nature, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly shevv he his fallen into ſome dreadful diſeaſe, that it is ſurely overſpread, with ſome horrid leproſie, and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the ſymptomes whereof now are moſt diſcernable. O what an exorbitancy doth appear in his deſires, with what contrary tydes, is he hurried? ſtill at jar with his preſent lot; his reaſon and will, once in a ſweet league are now at warr, betwixt which he is oft rent in pieces, as one betwixt wilde horſes; how is he now reſtleſs in an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable purſuit, he laboureth in the fire, and for a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; yea, what doe theſe tumults, and commotions of the earth mean, men upon the ſmalleſt account sheathing their ſwords in others bowels, <hi>homo homini Lupus;</hi> ruptures
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44187:76"/> in familyes, unſatiable in revenge, and the earth ſo oft in an uproar as a raging ſea. O doe not theſe too viſibly witneſs what a dreadful diſorder, and perturbation there muſt be within, impetuous boyling of mans luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that here we may ſee a very manifeſt rupture, and breath of building once well knitt, and framed</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would ask wherein mans true advantage and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, above others of the creatures can be ſeen, if not with ſome reſpect to that he once was, and that bleſſed reſtauration by grace; for his knowledge doth oft ſerve but to increaſe his ſorrow, to shew the good he wanteth, and the evil he is ſubject to; is there any of the creatures ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch outward miſery, and pain? to ſo many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as poor man now is? Yea, as to a ſenſual life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may we not ſay the beaſts have even ſome preference? or are theſe ſo unruely? do they ſo much go out of their bounds, and ſtation? which the many lawes made for man in the world with the convincing neceſſity thereof can wittneſs; we ſee alſo that fore travel is appointed to man; at hovv much toile he is for an outvvard ſubſiſtance, hovv he doth oft ſovv, and not reap; the beaſts vvithdravv from the yoke, theſe over vvhom he had dominion ready to aſſault him hovv vvomen bring forth their children in ſorrovv, the men are attended vvith fear, their life oft made bitter vvith care and labour, yea, as men increaſe in the vvorld, their care and diſcontent increaſing therevvith, but beſides all, is he not in the greateſt slavery of all the creatures through the violence of his luſts? that make him purſue the baite, though he knovveth it vvill undoe him, vvhile his corruption doth oft like a ſtrong man bind him in fetters, and his fleſh imperiouſly drag him at its heels; O may vve not ſay, vvas poor man thus formed at the beginning? or raiſed ſo far above the reſt of the creatures only, to make him the more miſerable for truely if a vive portraicture could be dravvn of ſinful depraved nature, there is none ſo groſſe but should-abhorr, yea be affrighted, to ſee that in the third perſon, vvith vvhich alace, they ſo friendly comply in themſelves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND. That ſo great a change is truely wrought upon men in converſion,</hi> as the ſcripture doth promiſe, and hold forth, <hi>Ioh. 3: ver. 3, 6. Eph. 2: ver. 1, 5. Coloſſ. 3: ver. 1, 2.</hi> vvherein ſome thing above nature, even the marvellous povver of the grace of God may be ſeen, is a trnth Iam ſure, knovvn, and undenyable to the vvorld, yea, the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateſt mockers at religion muſt confeſſe, can be no deluſion, but is indeed real, and certain; upon theſe follovving grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the moſt groſſe, vvho in their practice have been notourly profane, in the place vvherein they lived, it hath been ſeen that grace hath reached them and thus the Leopard hath been made to change his ſpots, and ſuch vvho vvere accuſtomed to do evil have learned to doe vvell. O! Doe not many famous inſtances vvitnes this, in every age? 2. That alſo men moſt principled in their jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement againſt the vvay of God, who were wont to deride holines as fancie, even on ſuch ſo great a change hath been wrought as hath made the world to wonder; but then they were forced to lay doun their prejudice, yea to wonder at themſelves, how they could ſtand before the truth ſo long, whereof they have got ſuch an impreſſion; ſure Atheiſts muſt grant there have been as profeſt Atheiſts as themſelves, who have been made eminent examples of grace. 3. That ſuch even in the height of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (like Paul breathing out cruelty, and of late <hi>Vergerius</hi> while he was writing againſt the truth) grace hath ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes reached them, it hath been found that of Chriſts greateſt enemyes ſome have thus fallen upon their high places before the power of the word; ſome ſuch trophees of the goſpels conqueſt have been conſpicuous in every age; yea it is oft ſeen that ſome remarkable height in ſin, hath proved an evident Criſis, and turn in mens condition either to jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, or mercy. 4. That ſome of the moſt eminent adverſaries of the truth have, through grace, been made eminently uſeful inſtruments in the Church the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny; that there have not been choiſer veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44187:77"/> more zealous for the Lord in their time then ſuch, who were once moſt violent in their oppoſition. 5. That ſuch whom the world did reckon moſt wiſe, and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea that did want no judgement to know the value of outward things, as well as others, grace hath reached, can the Atheiſts object, do any of the rulers, or Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies believe in Chriſt, or follow that way when it is ſo clear that not more wiſe, learned, and judicious (even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being judges) have been in their time then ſome vvho are moſt ſerious in the matter of Religion. 6. Hath not this change been made diſcernable, upon the ſimple; the moſt ſtupid, and dull, yea, upon ſome ſuch, as a natural incapacity might have obſtructed the worke if ſomething above nature had not carried it on, vvhich may be alſo manifeſt by ſome change even on their underſtanding, to shew that this can make the ſimple wiſe; and in the way of holines, the way-faring man though fool shall not err. 7. That by a very improbable mean, the word, and that ſometimes by weakeſt inſtruments, we ſee this great change hath been wrought, and it is remarkable, how litle of the work of converſion did follow the putting forth of miracles in the primitive times, but by the ſimplicity of the preached goſpel much more, for indeed the converſion of a ſoul, and ſuch a change is it ſelfe ſome way a miracle. 8. That they are not a few on whom this, change hath been wrought is undenyable; and truely beſides theſe ordinary proofs I think it is a great want there should not be ſome more ſpecial record by the Church, of theſe illuſtrious, and eminent inſtances of the grace of God, which have been in ſuch an age, as well as remarkable inſtances of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 9. Men muſt ſee this falleth not out at an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is wrought upon one, and not an other while both are a like diſcerning, yea, ſome who ſeem furtheſt from the grace of God, very groſſe, and rude, have been taken when the more civil, and refined, and of a more promiſing natural diſpoſition have been paſt by.

It is alſo known how great a cloud of witneſſes have ſealed this truth, O! can there be ſuch an univerſal enchantment, that in every age, in ſeveral yea in moſt remote places of the earth, hath fallen upon ſo many, who have witneſſed the povver of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; or can all theſe be void of underſtanding? What gain, or outward advantage could they deſigne in that which is ſo uſually attended with outward hazard, and loſſe, or what credit from men, while it maketh them the very butt of the worlds hatred, and reproach? Yea, can it be thought that all theſe could have combined to conſpire into ſo great a cheat? I muſt appeale Atheiſts to their ſerious thoughts of this matter. 12. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effect of this change, doth it not witneſs this is no fancy, or deluſion, when men are reached with ſuch a ſtroke, and by one word, as hath made the ſtout hearted and moſt daring to tremble, and to shew, by their very countenance that there is an other tribunal then mans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they are arraigned? Muſt it not be ſad earneſt and a marvellous povver, that can make ſo willing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce betvvixt men, and their idols, vvhich vvere once as their right eye to them, and beat them off that ground of ſelf-righteouſnes, vvhich they had been ſo long eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing to themſelves, that should cauſe them alſo chooſe the reproach of Chriſt, and his croſſe before any outvvard advantage, and abandon that ſociety without which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they could not live? Muſt not this ſpeak forth ſomething above nature, and natural reaſon. O! may not the world oft wonder what is become of their old friends, though I confeſſe this should rather put them with wonder, and aſtonishment, to ſome ſerious enquiry, whence ſo great a change can be.</p>

                  <hi>THIRD. Thus communion, and fellowship with God,</hi> whereto the Saints are in this life admitted, and brought
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44187:78"/> near to him in the ſpirit, <hi>is a moſt real thing,</hi> and no deluſion is a truth which may be very convincingly demonſtrat, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the view of the world, and to ſuch who are but onlookers on the ſame, 1 <hi>Iob. 1: ver. 3. Phil 3: ver.</hi> 20. I confeſſe this is a truth that muſt be ſpiritually diſcerned, and therefore the world cannot know it or reach that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy, and delight which is found by the Saints in that ſweet path; yet we muſt ſay there are ſomethings, and ſome ſuch and ſo convincing evidences, as may witneſs to men, and rationally demonſtrat the ſame; the conviction whereof they cannot poſſibly shun, if they but come near, and in their ſerious thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hovv great, and excellent a company doe bear this teſtimony, even as many as in every time did ever ſerve God in the Spirit; is not this tranſmitted by the fathers to the children as their experience? And as certainly tryed by ſucceeding ages, a truth vvhich is not once, or tvvice proved in the Chriſtians life, for the proofs thereof are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, and paſt reckoning, vvhich they have had, yea, amongſt all the Saints ſince the dayes of Abel, to this preſent time, there was never one contradictory witneſs could be produced.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are not theſe who do thus teſtify, what they have oft found in ſecret retirements to God, ſuch whoſe teſtimony in any other matter, the worſt of men could not refuſe or deny to be famous, I am ſure the World is convinced, that the followers of Chriſt dare not, yea, uſe not to deal falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other things with theſe they have to do with how ever their malice carry them to reproach them, yea, that they are more to be credited then ſuch, who make a ſcorn of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have they not had as great an intereſt, and share of the World as others, and been of as diſcerning ſpirits to know the true value of things, who from their experience doe not only declare, there is an undoubted reality in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, but that the joy and delight herein
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44187:78"/> which they have found, is above all the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſures of the flesh. O! what muſt that be which could make ſuch who wanted no outward allurements, who had not loſt their taſte, and were flesh, and blood as well as others to turn their back on all for Chriſt, and by their walk teſtify they have found ſome more ſatisfying enjoyment in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Muſt not this be very obvious, and convincing that when men once become ſerious in the way of God they have got ſome new acquaintance, that ſure is another world, and ſome other ſociety then that of men with which they have intercouſe? Whence are their frequent retirements, from which they have been ſeen ſo oft to come forth with greateſt ſatisfaction, and with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change in their caſe, doth it not thus appear <hi>They are not alone, when they are alone,</hi> yea, in ſuch a ſolitude muſt find ſomething very deſireable?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is not this alſo teſtifyed in ſuch times, when men could not well diſſemble, or be ſuſpected of deceit, in times of great outward affliction, when the World alſo hath been moſt tempting, with its offers, yea, at death when they are ſtepping over that threshold; a time, wherein the words of dying men are of greateſt weight, and credit, the ſpirits of ſuch being then more unbyaſſed, and free of theſe ordinary temptations wherewith others are ſwayed. How oft have they at ſuch times declared that ſurely God is familiar with men, which they have found, and though they were going to change their place, yet were not to change their company.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Can that be a deluſion which is ſo ſenſible in the preſent time, whereof the Saints are not more ſure that they live then they are ſure of this truth, what near approaches, what refreshing viewes they have got while God hath come near to their ſoul, what a diſcernable elevation of their ſpirits doth go along with this? yea, on the other hand, as the withdrawing hereof is very ſenſible to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo is there not ſomething of this obvious to by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, how great a change, and difference this will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44187:79"/> make in their caſe, from other times, which they cannot get hid?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Doth not ſomething of this truth appear on the very countenance, and outward carriage of Chriſtians, with what a luſtre, and reſemblance of Heaven a holy ſtayednes, and compoſure of ſpirit, when they have been brought neer God, in ſecret converſe with him, and taken up to that mountain; in a word, doth not the walk of a ſerious mortified Chriſtian convincingly witneſs this, yea, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſome way aſtonishing to the World, what should make them look ſo well, and with ſuch ſatisfaction, when no viſible cauſe for it, when shut up in priſon from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe vvith friends, and acquaintance? Sure men will not think any rational ſpirit ſo demented to quite their former pleaſures, and choſe the croſſe that they may only deceive the World, with a conterfeit joy and ſatisfaction, if they did not really find the ſame, and while it is too too evident, what a dreadful ſociety and commerce many have with the Devil, should any queſtion, or debate, whither the Saints have truely communion and fellowship with God the Father of Spirits, whom they ſerve, and worship.</p>

That the righteous is more excellent then his neighbour, Prov. 12: ver. 26.</hi> And hath an other ſpirit which is greater, and more choice, then that which is in the World, is a truth which, I am ſure, men notvvithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their prejudice muſt needs confeſſe, and that therein the Scripture is truely verifyed vvhen ſuch clear and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing evidences, doe ſtare them in the face.

               <p n="2">2. May it not alſo appear to onlookers that tender ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtians who live neer God, do truly witneſſe their reſemblance, &amp; likeneſſe to him to whom they move, as to their great, and laſt end, yea, do evidence, a more true excellency of ſpirit, what a ſweet calm, and ſerenity they have within, while going through things that are moſt croſſe, and vexing; with what diſcernable quietnes theſe can look upon moſt affrighting revolutions in the world, as ſuch, whoſe treaſure, and great intereſt is beyond hazard, though the earth were all turned to ashes.</p>

               <p>I would add that which the world cannot deny how this ſpirit which is in the Saints, hath prevailed over the greateſt entiſements of carnal gain, and pleaſure, which to many may ſeem a wonder, as the popish party did once ſay of Luther, <hi>Beſtia haet non cur at aurum,</hi> that which they did ſpeak in contempt, that it did prove him a beaſt, did in effect shew him therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be ſomething above men; for that is a thing before which the ſpirit of the world could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtand.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It can be no counterfeit, which should thus recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the chriſtian with a ſuffering lot, for it is known how very ſearching affliction and trouble proveth, which oft doth broach the veſſel, and bring forth what hath formerly moſt cloſely lurked: And O! doth not that holy confidence, and freedome which the ſaints have evidenced in confeſſing the truth, before the princes of this world and their moſt cruel adverſaries, yea, that chearfulnes which in moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pieces of ſuffering they oft doe wittneſs, even when they are reſiſting to the blood, doth not this, ſpeak forth ſomething beyond the gallantry of a natural ſpirit, that far exceedeth the ordinary way of men, and is a thing the world cannot reach yet cannot but wonder, and whither they will, or not ſee Gods very immediat help, and hand in the ſame, according to his word?</p>

How ſuch remarkable ſtrokes are ſeen to tryſt with ſome great, and remarkable height of ſin in ſuch a nation, and People, ſo that it is eaſy then for all onlookers to confeſſe the righteouſnes of God therein. 3. That vvhen judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is coming on a land it may be ſeen hovv inſtruments are raiſed, and in a more then ordinary vvay acted vvith all advantages for ſuch a piece of ſervice. 4. A viſible blaſting then both of counſel, and ſtrength, and theſe meanes vvhich othervvayes looked moſt probable, hovv remarkably ſuch are confounded even in the uſe of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary abilities their heart and uſual courage taken from them vvhile the Lord is on a vvork of judgement. 5. That aſtonishing ſucceſſe vvhich is uſually ſeen to follovv theſe vvhom the Lord ſendeth forth to execut his judgement, hovv then they move ſvviftly, and vvith vigour, they doe not ſtumble, or vveary, it is neither rivers, nor walled cities can ſtand in their way; mountaines are made vallies to shew it is the Lord whoſe hand in that day is ſtrong upon them, to ſtrengthen their loines, and make the ſword, and axe sharp for his ſervice. 6. Amidſt theſe various ſtrokes which come on a land, can men paſſe that of the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> without ſome ſpecial note, where Gods immediat hand, ſomething ſupernatural above ordinary, or natural cauſes may be clearly ſeen, both in its ſtrange progreſſe in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which like a lightning doth oft go throvv cities and countryes in a ſmall time; do not theſe tell aloud to the World that they come not unſent, and vvithout ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial commiſſion; and that there is no ſtryving againſt them, nor are ordinary meanes effectual in ſome ſuch extraordinary plagues until he vvho brought it on, do alſo by his ovvn hand take it off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is very obvious even to the world that clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance which is oft betwixt ſin, and the ſtroke, how holy juſtice doth keep a proportion, and doth shape out the judgement ſo exactly both in meaſure, and kind, that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44187:85"/> it may be eaſy to ſee, the ſtroke pointing, as with an hand to the cauſe, by its diſcernable likenes, and both at the righteous judgement of God which thus meaſureth out to men, as they have dealt with others: we ſee how the Lord tryſted Agag, and Adonibezek, how Sodoms bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning luſt was punisht with fire from heaven, yea what even David had meaſured out for his murther, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; the ſvvord shall not depart from his houſe, and for the other his wives by his own ſon abuſed, and truely every ages obſervation can witneſs this truth from many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing examples, that there is a God who judgeth in the earth, it being oft ſeen if men would ſeriously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. 1. How an univerſal overſpreading of ſin in a land, hath uſually ſome national, and univerſal ſtroke following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That blood waiteth on bloody men, and ſuffereth them not oft to live out half their dayes; one oppreſſour punished by another, the unmerciful man, payed home in his own coyn, by ſuch as shall shew as little mercy to him, or his. 3. How the proud, and inſolent who do moſt hunt after outward glory, are uſually tryſted vvith ſome humbling abaſing ſtroke, he povvreth contempt on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch vvho vvill not honour God, shall not brook that honour they ſeek from man. 4. That ſuch vvho have been moſt given vp to uncleannes are oft ſeen not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe as to their poſterity, but their iſſue obſerveably made to faile, yea, by a divine hand rooted out, ſure many ſuch ſignal examples might be inſtanced. 5. How ſuch who have chooſed ſin to shun trouble, and ſuffering, have in their ſinful way got as large a meaſure thereof, as that man who in Queen Maryes time ſaid, he could not burn for the truth, and therefore forſook it, by an unſeen hand had both himſelfe, and his houſe in one night burnt. 6. That the treacherous, and deceitful men are thus dealt with by others, yea, children who have been unduetiful to their parents, have from theirs met with the ſame recompence. 7. That whileſt men to make a purchaſe have even denyed themſelves the neceſſary uſe of outward things, are oft ſeen to leave their eſtate to ſuch, who do
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44187:86"/> quickly waſt and ſcatter the ſame, and thus the ſinful par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony of parents punished with the prodigality of ſuch who ſucceed them. 8. That the frequent uſe of ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imprecations are oft punished by the Lord with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtroke to the conviction both of themſelves, and onlookers, 9. How ſuch as have joyned together, and united themſelves againſt the truth have been viſibly broken as to their own privat intereſt, and truely we muſt ſay there is oft ſuch a tryſt of very convincing circumſtances, in ſome acts of the judgement of God, with ſuch a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the ſin, yea, judgement ſometime purſueing men in the very place, where the ſin hath been acted that it may be eaſy for all who go by to ſay, there is indeed a God who judgeth in the earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth it not appear, how very convincing and obvious this truth is even to the world, from theſe ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes, and proverbial ſayings which we find in all ages, and in every part of the earth, even the moſt rude, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant have had, of the judgement of God; for truely what elſe are theſe but an expreſſe witnes, how univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally this truth is known, and received by men, how much the world is convinced thereof, through a long tract of obſervation from the fathers to the children, yea, thence they have had a divinity of their own, drawn out thereof, how ſuch ſins do not uſe to paſſe without ſome notour pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Now I would but name ſome few of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes, that have been moſt uſual in all times. 1. How ſome familyes have not thriven, but a ſecret judgement hath been diſcernable thereon ſince, they had hand in ſome groſſe acts of wickedneſſe; ſuch as bloodshed, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proſperity from ſuch a day viſibly declining. 2. How that an evil purchaſe uſeth not to be of long continuance, but their eſtate oft in a very ſtrange, and unſenſible way made to evanish, which their children though frugal can by no meanes keep up, and the cauſe hereof, men doe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily point at, it was purchaſed by fraud tranſmitted with a curſe cleaving thereto, and ſo there was no warding of the judgement of God. 3. Such who doe not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44187:86"/> Gods contraverſy, yet are oft forced to remark that ſince ſome have medled, or matched with ſuch an houſe, they have ſadly ſmarted thereby, ſomething of a curſe even following the race, and poſterity of ſome. 4. How ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious medling with that which hath been for a pious, and publick uſe hath cauſed a viſible waſt and conſumption in their own eſtate. 5. That mens asking counſel from the Devil, and turning to that airth for their help, doth uſually reſolve in a ſad, and tragick cloſe, and truly this many in the shutting up of their life have been forced to confeſſe. 6. That falshood doth not uſe to keep its feet, nor a wicked way long proſper, what ever it ſeeme to the firſt view, yea, I may adde as one of the Worlds remarks which they cannot well shun, that which ſeemeth was an ordinary ſaying in the time of Eſter, that it is not ſafe troubling the Church, or for men to ſtate themſelves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that party, and I dare not queſtion, but this shall be yet as convincing, and obvious to the World as it hath been in any former ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is not the appearance of a divine hand oft very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the World in the diſcovery of ſin, and bringing to light ſome groſſe acts of wickednes, even in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, while it is ſeen. 1. By what ſtrange unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected meanes, theſe have been brought forth, ſuch an aſtonishing tryſt, and concurrence of things therein as hath forced not only onlookers, to ſome ſpecial remark, but hath even ſtruck the guilty party through the heart with wonder, and conviction of the ſame. 2. How the hand of Juſtice perſuing men for ſome notour, and known crime, doth oft bring to light ſome that have been moſt ſecret, which they thought the World could never reach, yea, it may be frequently ſeen while men have been in one ſin found out, it hath alſo brought forth the diſcovery of ſome other, and forced them to confeſſe, that is was a righteous judgement perſuing them for the ſame. It is a thing alſo known, yea, by many undenyable inſtances witneſſed that marvellous diſcovery of concealed murther, by the bleeding of the body upon the touch of the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44187:87"/> I confeſſe it should be hard to aſſert the lawful, and warrantable practice of ſuch an appeal to ſo extraordinary, and ſtupendious a ſign from the Lord, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goeth not clearly before us, but on the other hand, ſuch a thing ſo ſurely tryed for ſuch an end, and in the caſe where all ordinary meanes of diſcovery have been wanting, I think calleth us to a ſerious remark thereof, while it ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiby ſeemeth to witneſs his hand, who doth make inquifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for blood.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is not the dreadful conſternation, theſe tormenting feares which men after ſome groſſe acts of wickedneſſe do bewray, a very obvious witneſs to this truth, that there is a God who judgeth on the earth, in whoſe hands it is a terrible thing to fall, and sheweth how great a punishment wickednes is to its ſelfe, truely if Atheiſts turn not bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and ſtupid, they muſt notice this, and confeſſe a thing which doth ſo oft reach their eares, what have been the horrid cryes of many dying men who have moſt ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſin in their life; that may tell byſtanders there is a judge who can ſtretch forth his hand on the ſoul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereto no rack, or outward torments is any way comparable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I would furder adde theſe extraordinary ſigns, and prodigies which do uſually go before ſome ſtroke and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on a land, do they not clearly point at a divine hand in the ſame? For as theſe are a ſolemn forewarning from Heaven to give men an alarum, before remakable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the truth whereof the World cannot deny, ſo we muſt ſay they are a convincing teſtimony, that theſe judgements are no caſual things, which the Atheiſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer, it being ſo clear. 1. That ſuch ſignes, and prodigies, have been in every age viſible to the World, experience, and the graveſt hiſtories both of auncient, and later times, do fully witnes. 2. That ſuch things should alſo be previous to great revolutions in the World, we know the Scripture is moſt expreſſe, <hi>Ioel 2: ver. 30.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44187:87"/> inadvertency at theſe ſtrange works of the Lord, which call both for fear, and obſervation. 3.

               <p n="1">1. That in this the Scripture is truely fulfilled which doth witnes what theſe Spirits are, adverſaries to man, in their nature, and inclination deſperatly evill, whoſe actings in the earth, have a viſible tendency to mens hurt, and ruin, yea, their pretended favours, alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to that end, whence we ſee, ſuch a natural inbred horrour which is in man againſt them.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Is it not an undenyable conſequence of this truth that there muſt be an inviſible World that hath inhabitants of another kinde then ſuch as are here, that ſure there is ſome being above man, yea a real correſpondence betwixt men, and Spirits, and should not man thus placed in a middle eſtate betwixt the Angels and the beaſts here below par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in his body with the one, but in his reaſonable ſoul with the other thence raiſe himſelfe to thoughts of ſome more excellent condition for which he is framed, then a ſenſual life, and that ſurely the ſoul hath an intereſt in an other world, which he should moſt look after?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Muſt not this alſo be ſure that there is an inviſible guard, and theſe deſperat Spirits are under reſtraint by a power ſtronger then they which can bound their malice, for, this may be certain that theſe who have ſo great enmity to man, are ſo near, and have ſuch advantages over us, could not keep at ſuch a diſtance, but that they are keept in chaines by a higher power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How is it that now by the Goſpel and within this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of the Church, Sathans power is ſo much reſtrained in reſpect of former times while it is known what a familiar converſe they had with men, did even haunt their houſes and were ſo publick in their appearance under ſuch names of <hi>Fairies,</hi> and <hi>Brounies</hi> which ſince the breaking up of the light of the Goſpel hath not been, yea hath not the Devil to this day an open throne and dominion in theſe parts of the earth where Chriſt is not worshiped, it is alſo known, how the oracles of old did ceaſe, and that publick worship which the world for many ages had given them, with the very time of Chriſts apearance, and breaking up of the Goſpel theſe night beaſts getting to their dennes, when once the day was broke up. Plutarch, and other heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en writers are a witnes to this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whence is it that within the Church where Sathan is moſt reſtrained, yet there he doth more ſtur then in all the world beſids? Doth it not shew that that is the party
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44187:89"/> with which he is at war, hence doth he more rage, the more clear the light shineth, yea, is there not ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, beſids mens natural enemity at the truth, even a fury, and violence wherewith ſome are viſibly driven in their actings with ſuch an unſatiable cruelry againſt the followers of Chriſt, without the leaſt shadow of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as holds forth a vive reſemblance of the Devil, and ſome violent preſſure, and incitement from that airth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Is it not ſure that there is ſuch a party, by this, that he is an adverſary to God, and holines, for which he doth ſo impetuouſly tempt, and preſſe men to the outward acts of ſin, yea, that there is a Spirit of blaſphemy which ſo viſibly rageth in the world, and acts men to war againſt Heaven with their tongues by curſing, and blaſphemous oathes which hath no carnal pleaſure or gain, but yet, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear, from a violent incitement which may be ſeen ſwaying them to the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whence is it which is ſo very known and notour that theſe horrid wretches who give themſelves to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill cannot enter in any formal engadgement without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Chriſt, and their baptiſme, doth it not shew that direct oppoſition he ſtands in to Chriſt, yea to the very name and shadow of Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whence is it that even the groſſeſt Atheiſts upon any appearance of the Devil, or apprehenſion from that airth will not then make ſcorn of prayer, but turns in earneſt to that, which at other times they mocked. O doth it not shew mens Atheiſm is their choice, but not their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that not onely there is a dreadful horrour, and fear which by nature men have of theſe evil Spirits, but ſome inbred ſenſe alſo, and impreſſion of a Deity, which doth bewray it ſelfe whither they will, or not, in a preſſing ſtrait, and extremity.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That it is ſeen no privat quarrel which ever was among men hath been with ſuch vigour, and malice perſued, as this upon the account of religion, which hath ſtill put the World more in a flame, then any privat intereſt, yea, it is very manifeſt how men are carried with the ſpaite of their own natural inclination, to oppoſe the Church, and People of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this feed, and enmity could never be taken up through all the ſucceſſions of time, a ſtrife which is not late begun, or to be ſeen only in one age, betwixt the children of the bond woman, and of the free, no, the moſt ſage, and wiſe amongſt men the greateſt Peace-makers, could yet never fall on a way to reconcile theſe two parties, but, the children have ſtill ſerved themſelves heirs to the quarrell, and hatred of their fathers againſt the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not ſeen that theſe who are more civil, and can hold a little up with the form of religion, yet, will break forth in greateſt rage againſt the power thereof when once it begins to appear? it is indeed here, that imbred contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which is in men againſt holines, doth bewray it ſelfe, even, in theſe who are other wayes noted for a calm, and peaceable diſpoſition, while once they begin to be ſcorcht with its heat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What a ſtrong natural antipathy is this which cauſeth men pnrſue with ſo much bitternes theſe from whom they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44187:90"/> never had any perſonal injury? ſure their conſcience muſt oft tell that they have no reaſon, or any other provocation then what is from the appearance of the image of God in ſuch, but this is their nature, and indiſpoſition, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which they can no more help, then they can change their nature, or the Leopard can change its ſpots.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From what a ſtrong inclination, and inward principle doth the World thus act in its oppoſition to the Church and followers of God? whileſt it is clear, that though theſe were never ſo quiet and peaceable, yet their enemyes are ſtill reſtleſſe, and cannot ſleep beſide them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is ſeen how this doth ſeparat betwixt neareſt friends, and relations, and alienat ſuch who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been moſt dear to other, no bond in nature ſo ſtrait which it will not break, it doth oft ſet the husband againſt the wife and the parents againſt the children, yea, when religion once breaks up in a corner of a land, or a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth it not then make a viſible jarr, and put all in a flame?</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is clear that when once grace appeareth in men they are as a ſign, and wonder to a profane generation, the World doth then ſenſibly change her countenance, and looketh like a ſtep-mother, while on the other hand it is clear that profeſſours turning looſe, and running to that exceſſe of riot with others, will cauſe their old adverſaries warm towards them, and alace, proveth the ſureſt way to gain mens frienship while the World thinks, they are their own, when once they turn profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</p>

               <p>It is true the cauſe, and ſolid remedy of this ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a complaint, is only reached by the Godly man, who knoweth how to read the vanity of the creature, as a piece of the fulfilling of the word, and doth ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things as they are &amp; not as they appear, but it is alſo ſure, that in every age through the various changes of mans life this is ſo cleirly witneſſed, that the moſt groſſe, and brutish, cannot shift the conviction thereof, but in one of theſe two times have been forced to a publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the ſame, at death, when they are leaving the World, or in a day of ſtrait when the World is leaving them, now to demonſtrat this I shall here but offer theſe few queries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have not the greateſt inſtances of the glory of the World, been uſually the greateſt examples of its vanity, and change? how few hath ambition raiſed, but it hath alſo ruined, yea, given the ſoreſt fall to theſe it had lifted moſt high?

How very poor are ſome amidſt their fulnes, more then theſe who earn their bread with ſore labour, whom the world doth wholly poſſeſſe, while they do not at all poſſeſſe it, neither is it in their power to make uſe of that they have, yea, are they not ſick and dy in Princes courts, as well as in the meaneſt cottage, and the complaints of the great, and rich uſually moe then theſe of the poor? Sure it is known that the great man doth oftner want a ſtomack, and reſt, then the poor want meat and a bed to ly in.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In what an endleſſe circle do voluptuous men move, from one thing to another in a perpetual ſearch after other enjoyments to ſatiſfy their ſpirits? which sheweth what a great want is there, which ſtill cals for variety of things, and ſome fresh ſupply, to take off the wearineſſe of one pleaſure by another, elſe the delight they have therein, would quickly languish, and wear out, yea, is it not ſtill found that the beſt of outward things are not on a near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach what they ſeemed to be at a diſtance, the eye not ſatiſfyed with ſeeing, nor the ear with hearing, but the more they are preſſed the leſſe the yeeld, neither do they enjoy ſuch things with moſt ſatiſfaction who take a full draught, who wallow, and ſteep themſelves in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, being more in expectation then in poſſeſſion, ſo that ſometime mens attaining their deſire hath cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their delight, and pleaſure in theſe things ceaſe.</p>

Are not men going through the World and leaving it behind them in the midſt of their moſt ſatiſfying enjoyments? is not the excellency of moſt outward things onely according to opinion, of the inſtitution of men, while they have but ſmall intrinſick worth from their own quality? in ſome parts of the earth, whitneſſe is reckoned deformity, and the blackeſt collour the greateſt beauty, and therefore they paint the Devil white, what a poor ſmoke is ſwelling titles of honour if ſoberly weighed? vvhile the proud mans happines, doth ſomeway hang upon the poor who goe by, which they muſt beg from others with the greateſt artifice; and would the choiceſt jewels, or a bag of gold laid upon the heart of a dying man, any way quiet his ſpirit, or eaſe his pain?

For innumerable inſtances can witnes what marvellous joy, and ſatisfaction the Saints have shewed at a ſtake, and upon a ſcaffold, and thence hath had a more chearful going out of time, then the rich man ſtretched upon his ſoft bed, or the greateſt Monarch, amidſt all outward advantages, ſure we muſt ſay, that ſweet refreshing cloſe of the upright man, hath never been more viſible, and writ in greater letters, then in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What very ſad conflicts have ſome of the Saints had in their life, yea, even upon the ſetting of the ſun hath been put to cry out through ſore perplexing feares, and doubts wherewith they have been aſſaulted, who have at laſt had this turned into a ſong, and ſuch a marvellous change in their caſe, as hath not been more ſenſible to themſelves, then diſcernable to all onlookers, like a ſudden calm, and ſunshin, after ſome dark ſtorm. I muſt here ask the Atheiſt, and ſuch as reckon Godlineſſe but a fancy whence should ſo ſtrange, ſo ſudden, and great alteration proceed, that theſe who a little before were under ſuch horrour, could have no reſt, no arguments could do their tnrn, doe thus witnes the aboundant peace of their ſouls, yea, which is oft ſeen that fervent deſire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome of the Saints are taken away, the very luſtre of heaven being upon their countenance, how marvellous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44187:94"/> and piercing are their words, which may cleerly tell that now they feel, they ſee, and have got ſome glance of that, which onlookers cannot reach, though they cannot deny an acknowledgement of this.</p>

               <head>THE FOURTH ARGUMENT</head>
               <p>I shall here offer to prove the Scriptures accomplishment is this, <hi>That whereof the most part, as to theſe ſpecial predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and promiſes that concern the Church, is fulfilled, and hath now taken place in their appointed times, which we may at this day clearly tead in the event, and but a litle part thereof now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to be made out, must be a ſure truth.</hi> But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thus fulfilled, and the prophecyes. thereof now made legible in the hiſtory of providence, and in the works of God about his Church. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I would premit here ſome few things ere I ſpeak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to this argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the Scripture is thus wonderfully ſuited by the Lord, and taketh place in every generation as if it were alone directed to that time, yet, it is alſo clear that a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part thereof hath its proper accomplishment in theſe ages, and periods of time, to which it doth in a peculiar
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44187:94"/> way relate, ſome part of it, which did concern the times of the Old Teſtament, ſome that doth alſo anſwer to the times of the Goſpel, and a part of it which hath a peculiar reſpect to theſe latter dayes, which the Lord is now bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and we wait for a more full accomplishment, that it is on a near approach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo ſure that the whole work of God, and his providence about his Church here in the World which was perfect from the beginning, and before him from eternity, is comprehended under the written word, where the Lord hath fully revealed his minde, and counſel anent every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and concernment of the Church; though we oft be in the dark in finding out the ſame, but the event will in due time ſpeak for it ſelfe, which should cauſe us until then, with much ſobriety paſſe our judgement on ſome of theſe truths that are not yet fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear that the Prophets of old did not onely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ſuch great changes, and revolutions, as were to go over the Churches head, and declare the certainty thereof, but we find theſe prophecyes oft point at the times, and periods of time whereto they did relate, and though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in dark tearmes, yet did clearly shew that there was a certain prefixed time, &amp; not at every time they could have their performance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We would conſider how the full accomplishing of the Scripture, and the perfecting the Lords work about his Church. will be at once, and doth keep foot together, and then shall a full, and ſatisfying diſcovery of Gods way, and providence, and all that he hath been doing in the World clearly break up, when the great myſtery of God in his written word is finished, and the Church ſo near to land.</p>
               <p>That I may ſpeak a little to ſo grave a ſubject, I would lay down theſe two things to be conſidered. 1. How much of the Scripture, and predictions thereof may be now ſeen clearly verifyed in the event. 2. What doth yet remain to have an accomplishment in theſe laſt times by which we may certainly judge, hovv near the Lords vvork
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44187:95"/> about his Church is to a cloſe; anent the firſt I shall point at ſome of theſe moſt concerning events, &amp; changes vvhich the Church hath met vvith, vvherein vve may ſee vvhat of the Scripture may at this day be read in the hiſtory of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and is certainly fulfilled.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>I. WHAT IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. Let us go back to theſe firſt times after the fall, and ſee <hi>that dreadful ſtroke which came upon the old World by the flood after an univerſal defection from God,</hi> and we shall there find the fulfilling of that which Noah that great preacher of righteouſnes had oft foretold, and of theſe threatnings which by Moſes were there recorded, wherein it may be very manifeſt. 1. That this truth beſides Divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no records of auncient times no antiquity could ever contradict, yea, ſome of the eldeſt writers doe clearly witnes ſomething of an univerſal deluge over the earth with the ſtrange preſervation of ſome from it, however they were in the dark as to many circumſtances thereanent. Joſephus doth cite Beroſus the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aldean about this, who without doubt had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome of theſe oldeſt records true, &amp; uncorrupt. Euſebius alſo doth mention ſome fragments of Abidenus, and Appollidorus, which in his time were extant, clearly pointing at the flood, and at Noah under the name of Ziſuthrus with his ſending out of birds to ſee if the waters were aſſwaged. 2. There is nothing here doth contradict reaſon, how this might be brought about, even in the way of ordinary natural cauſes, which the Lord did make uſe of for that end; for we find the windowes of Heaven were opened the air being condenſed into clouds, and their retentive power louſed, theſe great floodgates were thus ſet louſe; which falling not in drops, but all in a full bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like the ſpouts and cataracts of the Weſt-Indies might ſoon overwhelm the earth with aboundance of water, while theſe fountaines alſo of the great deep beneath were broken up, which was not only the Ocean let forth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44187:95"/> to go over its banks, but an univerſal vent to all the veines of the earth, and that great maſſe of waters which is in the bowels thereof, which from beneath meeting theſe that were from above, may give men a clear, and rational account how ſuch a thing might be. 3. This piece of the Scripture, is moſt congruous, and aggreable to the whole, and the great ſcope, and drift of the ſame, for it points out an height of ſin, and of wrath, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall defection, and an univerſal ſtroke meeting together, it leads us forward to Chriſt, of whom the ark was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent shadow, and of that ſalvation which in, and by him the Church hath from eternal wrath, and is a very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt pledge, and ſign of that laſt deſtruction of the World, which though not in that manner, yet, shall once ſurely be, and find men in ſuch a condition, as this flood found them into in the dayes of Noah.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. What we have expreſly promiſed in the word of <hi>the Churches delivery from Egypt,</hi> and vvas foretold by Joſeph at his death, that God should ſurely bring back his People out of that land, for vvhich he left his bones to ly unburied as a pledge thereof, hath novv many ages paſt been fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. It is long ſince that remarkable day vvhen God made a vvay for his People through the red ſea, and his povver knovvn upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptians, ſince Moſes vvith the Church did ſing that triumphant ſong, the horſe, and his rider he hath caſt in the ſea, vvherein theſe things are moſt clear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this vvas a deed knovvn, and publick in the time, vvhich vvas not done in a corner, but in the vievv of the World, and before all the Children of Iſrael, and by them atteſted, and vvith greateſt carefulnes tranſmitted to their Children, and by theſe to the follovving genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as a thing never to be forgotten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Was teſtifyed by Moſes ſo great a perſon, and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitnes thereof, one vvhom even the moſt auncient of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vvriters, do mention vvith much reſpect, and in this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44187:96"/> did never challenge his teſtimony, though a matter of fact, and of that moment. vvhich all the nations about could not but knovv, and both in the preſent and after ages have the remembrance thereof keeped up; ſo that they might eaſily refute ſuch a thing if falſe, and vve may judge the Egyptians, and many others, could vvant no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvill to put diſgrace on a People they ſo much hated, nor be ignorant of that vvhich Moſes published in his ovvn time, to vvhoſe vvorks ſome of the auncienteſt heathen vvriters, doe shew they have been no ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A truth which by Moſes was put in record, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Jewes to be keept by them, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in all ſucceeding ages, a record which they did ſo narrowly look to, and had in that reverence, and eſteem, that all the ſyllabs, and letters thereof were by them num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, leſt in the ſmalleſt point it should be wronged, yea, were more careful to preſerve it then any nation can be of their moſt concerning rights, and charters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A thing whereof the remembrance was yearly from that time celebrat by the Jewish Church, whence the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the paſſover had its riſe, that deliverance being as a ſign, and ſacramentall pledge of that great ſalvation, by him who is our true paſſover.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. What is held forth in the Scripture concerning <hi>the more full grouth of the Iewish Church</hi> that Judah should enjoy a Scepter, which was foretold by dying Jacob, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed once and again to Abraham by the Lord that his ſeed should be as the ſand of the ſea, and enjoy Canaan for an inheritance hath it not long ſince been fulfilled? Wherein theſe things are clear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for many ages Iſrael did enjoy that land in a moſt flowrishing condition which doth in part appear from theſe very ruines, and deſolation, over which they have ſo long lamented, the glory of Ieruſalem, and the temple once ſo famous, which cauſeth ſuch reverence amongſt them to the very rubbish thereof at this day.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44187:96"/>2. That they were once a People by themſelves who were not mingled with the Nations, but keept at a diſtance by their Religion, and Lawes, from the reſt of the World as a peculiar People to the Lord is a thing undenyable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That whileſt they enjoyed it there was a ſingular bleſſing of fruitfulnes thereon above other places, ſo as that ſmall piece of ground, was eneugh for an innumerable multitude of inhabitants, but is novv at this day a barren ſand, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary curſe no leſſe ſeen thereon then the bleſſing was in former times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo evident that ſomething in the way, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of this people, even in their low, wandering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth diſcover they have not forgot what once they were, nor their former grandour, and flovvrishing, but ſtill keep by themſelves vvith ſome reſpect to their ovvn land, vvhich their fathers did enjoy.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That piece of the Scripture vvhich did concern the <hi>declining times of the Church under the Old Teſtament,</hi> vvhat Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy foretold of the Babylouish captivity hath novv many ages ſince been fulfilled, a truth vvhich vve have atteſted by ſacred hiſtory, an hiſtory vvhich doth clearly juſtify it ſelf, and its authority by ſuch convincing marks thereof, that vve may ſay, theſe vvho do ſeriouſly converſe vvith the vvord, cannot take up Atheiſme vvithout the laying down of reaſon, and putting a force upon their ovvn light.</p>
                  <p>Novv as to this particular prophecy vve vvould but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That vvhich Jeremy did foretel anent the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, vvas not its accomplishment put on record in a book of the Churches lamentations? vvhere this truth may be read in her teares, and truely ſuch as ever knevv grief in a high meaſure, may eaſily knovv vvhat is there expreſt to be ſad earneſt, and read the lively motions of an afflicted caſe therein, and beſides hath not this been witneſſed to after ages by a viſible monument, even the deſtruction of the temple, that great, and excellent work which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44187:97"/> though after rebuilt did never attain its former ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This was a matter of fact of great note, and famous in the time, done in the view of all the nations, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable piece of the Babylonish conqueſt, yea that teſtimony the Scripture beareth to the ſame, was it not a few ages after made publick to other parts of the world by the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint translation, ſo that it had been eaſy for Ptolemy or any in that time to have diſcovered the falſehood of a thing ſo lately done, yet, theſe times nor the moſt profeſſed enemyes to the Church therein, could not in the leaſt contradict the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though much of humane hiſtory, and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of auncient times that vve now have, are both corrupt and defective, yet, there wants not ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, from the ſureſt of theſe, to many of the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable things that we have of the hiſtory of the old teſtament, and as to the certanity of this truth beſids its own authority, we will find ſome of theſe oldeſt writers Beroſus, Herodot, and Xenophon, give ſome light to the ſame, whoſe witnes the Atheiſt cannot challenge, yea, is it not clear that Ioſephus not only from ſacred hiſtory but from theſe old records, and fragments of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times which were then extant (though ſince have been much loſt) compoſe his Iewish antiquityes, which give ſo particular a relatiou of this truth.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. What was foretold by Daniel concerning <hi>the riſe, and fall of the Monarchies,</hi> and change of theſe great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, who had been ſo ſore a rod upon the Church, hath it not many ages paſt had a moſt punctual performance? It is now long ſince that great image shewed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in a viſion, hath been brought down, and broken, ſo that ſcarſe the toes thereof doe now remain, which beſides the witnes of the Scripture, may be clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat upon other rational grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:44187:97"/>1. It being granted that the prophecie of Daniel was translated in Greek, and laid up in that great library of Alexandria, long before much of it was fulfilled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antiochus Epiphanes, and the riſing of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire which Porphyrius could not be ignorant of though all he could anſwer to that evident agreement betwixt his prophecie, and the event, was that it muſt have been writ, after theſe things were accomplished, whileſt it is clear, that a part of the prophecie of Daniel which concerned the fourth Monarchy, was not even in his times fully made out, yea, we muſt ſay ſomething thereof doth reach to the laſt end of time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is alſo undenyable that in theſe great revolutions of the Monarchies there is a diſcernable conſent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt the Scripture, and theſe auncient records which we yet have of theſe times, ſo that not only the things themſelves, but ſome of the moſt obſervable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof which are particularly mentioned by Daniel, we may read in Xenophon, Herodot, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Siculus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It muſt alſo be granted that ſomethings which in Daniels propheſie would ſeem moſt ſtrange, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, ſuch as Belshazars death in that very night the hand writing was shewed to him, may be particularly underſtood in Xenophons hiſtory how Cyrus took the advantage of the Babylonian security whileſt they were in the midſt of a ſolemn feaſt, and by diverting the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of Euphrates did enter the city vvithout oppoſition; alſo hovv that great horn of the high goat vvas ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly broken and the comming up of four in his room, vvhich by Daniel are expounded of the Grecian Monarchy, and the deviding of that Empire after Alexanders death, is it not punctuallie held forth by all the hiſtoryes of that time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Was there not a very convincing appearance of a divine hand, both in the riſe, and fall of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies and an extraordinary providence vvhich vve cannot but ſee vvhen vve read theſe hiſtories, that ſurely
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44187:98"/> ſomething above ordinary meanes, and ſecond cauſes vvas both in Cyrus conqueſt againſt the Babylonians, and the marvellous ſvvift progreſſe, and ſucceſſe of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander againſt the Perſians.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That which was the great ſcope of all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies under the Old Teſtament. <hi>The comming of the Meſſias</hi> is ſurelie verifyed, and now many ages paſt hath had an accomplishment, the Lord is come unto his temple even he whoſe day Abraham, and the Saints under the law did long after; this was the moſt happie, and notable criſis that ever the Church was under, the great Epocha, and period of time from which she doth now reckon, which we know is no fable, or cunning device of man, that God was manifeſted in the flesh, did make his abode, for ſome time in the earth, ſuffered at Ieruſalem in the view of the World, before many witneſſes, did ariſe from death on the third day, was ſeen, and known by his diſciples thereafter, and having finished the work for which he came vvas received up again into glory.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed a great truth vvhich concerneth us no leſſe to knovv, and be ſure of, then our ſoul is vvorth, and intereſt through eternity, the fulfilling vvhereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids the authority of ſacred writ, the witnes, and records of the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt who teſtifie what they certainly knew, is a truth which from ſuch convincing rational grounds, may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the greateſt height of Atheiſme knoweth not how to ſtate it ſelfe in direct oppoſition to the ſame; and truely in this the Lord hath ſo tendered the ſtrengthning of his peoples faith and their encouragement; that as it is the moſt concerning promiſe of the Scripture, on which our whole hope, and bleſſednes depends, ſo is it alſo moſt clear, and conſpicuous in the event: I shall but onely touch this, whereof ſo much hath been ſaid by others.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:44187:98"/>1. It is undenyable the Meſſias was to come, to whom all the Sacrifices under the Law theſe auncient, types, and shadowes did clearly point, to whom the Prophets bear witnes, and was the faith of the auncient Iewish Church, of which promiſe, they were perſwaded even whileſt they ſaw it but a far, yea did embrace it, and repoſe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves thereon, yea, is there not a moſt clear, and exact por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture drawn forth under the Old Teſtament, of the Meſſias, what an one he should be, and by what peculiar characters he should be known, who was to be revealed to Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſpecial ſeaſon, and period of time wherein Chriſt should come, we find prefixed, and shewed to the auncient Church, which though under ſome figurative expreſſions, ſeemed then dark, yet, was ſo far revealed that upon a diligent ſearch, and enquiry, and particular collation of the times, it might be eaſy to diſcern the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias comming, and near approach, of which ſalvation the Prophets did enquire, 1. <hi>Pet. 1: ver.</hi> 10. and truely the fall of the Monarchies, and right uptaking of Daniels weeks, were ſure, and ſolide grounds, for a clear computation thereanent; thence was it that ſo general an expectation of the Meſſias was among the Iewes, at that very time when he came, ſo as divers impoſtoures did ariſe whom the People was ready to follow, and we ſee with what amazement the Phariſees did enquire at Iohn the Baptiſt if he were the Chriſt, or not, yea, Ioſephus sheweth how the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this did moſt excite that People to war with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans from the prophecies they had in holy writ, that from Iudea should about that time come who vvas to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is alſo ſure there vvas ſuch an one vvho in the dayes of Tiberius, and under the reign of Herod was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to Iſrael, and came with no outward shew, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but did great, and marvellous things before all the People, was crucified at Ieruſalem, under Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and notwithſtanding the ignominy of his death was after adored, and followed, both by many of the Iews and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44187:99"/> the gentils, whoſe doctrine did alſo in a short time ſpread through the World, a truth which the greateſt adverſaries of the Goſpel have ever confeſſed, and do atteſt the hiſtory thereof de facto, to be a faithful relation, not only Iewes, but the heathen writers Suetonius, Tacitus, and Plinius the younger that lived near and ſome of them contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Is it not clear how this appearance of Chriſt to the World, did exactly tryſt with the very time, foretold by the Prophets thereanent? Was not Jacobs prophecy, thus accomplished? for until that time it is clear the royal line of Davids houſe, did not ceaſe, until Herod a ſtranger came to reign, by whom it was utterly cut off, and it is manifeſt theſe 70 weeks mentioned by Daniel, muſt be underſtood of years elſe they could admit no other ſence, which reckoning from the decree, given out by Cyrus, to rebuild the temple, are 490 Yeares, and doth anſwer to the very time of Chriſts being in the World, and his death, which neceſſarly fals in the laſt of theſe weeks, a thing ſo manifeſt, that Porphyrius an avowed enemy to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion could have no anſwer, but that this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had been deviſed after the event, which I am ſure the Jewes, though as direct adverſaryes, vvould be loath to admit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is moſt clear that in him vvho at that time vvas revealed to Iſrael, vvhom the Chriſtian Church doth this day vvorship, vvas exactly accomplished vvhatever vvas by the Prophets to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. There is an innumerable company who have embraced the Goſpel, and received the ſpirit by the miniſtry thereof ſince the times of the Apoſtles who have put this ſeal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all ages that it is the power, and wiſdome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and truely without partial reſpect (which the conſcience of the worſt of men have been forced to juſtify) it may be ſaid, theſe were the excellent of the earth in their time, many of greateſt outward parts, and abilities, whoſe moral integrity, and candour was beyond queſtion even with their adverſaries, and theſe both of Iewes, and gentils of all rancks of men, of all nations, and languages, who not only by a naked profeſſion, but by their walk, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did shew forth the power, and vertue of a crucified Chriſt, yea, shine as lights whileſt they were in the World to the conviction of onlookers, and is not this a convinceing witnes to the truth of the Goſpel which its enemyes cannot poſſibly deny.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That excellent doctrine delivered to the Church in the New Teſtament by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles doth it not clearly shew whence it is, and witnes its own authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? for here we may ſee a manifeſt agreement, betvvixt this, and the doctrine of the auncient Ievvish Church, that as the five Books of Moſes hold forth the ſum of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the Covenant of grace, and that myſtery of Salvation by Chriſt, ſo the Prophets do carry it on vvith furder clearnes, and the Evangeliſts brings forvvard like an excellent edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that is founded, and advanced in the one, but perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other, all breathing the ſame ſpirit vvith a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing tendency to the ſame end, ſo that vve may ſay the old Jewes under the Law, were in effect Chriſtians, and the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44187:100"/> followers of Chriſt now under the Goſpel in ſome reſpect are Jewes, being one in the ſubſtantials of their religion; for it is clear, that poor Apoſtat people, now in the Iewish nation, hath wholly departed from their own doctriue, and will not come to the light that they may be judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Old Teſtament; now in this I would ſeriouſly atteſt the adverſaries of the Goſpel, if paganiſme, the Turks Alcoran, or Iewish Talmud hold forth any ſuch doctrine, or rule, as that which the Chriſtian Religion doth, ſuch pure, and excellent precepts to reſtrain the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy of corrupt affection backed with arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an immortal ſoul, a doctrine ſo ſincere, ſolid, and rational ſo conſiſtent with it ſelfe, and agreable to the true ſcope, and drift thereof, which holds forth, the moſt exquiſite rule of perfection, for men to preſſe after, yea, where every page, and line breatheth forth holines towards God, and righteouſnes, and humanity towards man.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I shall adde, theſe clear convincing evidences of the truth of the Goſpel, which did attend the firſt publishing thereof, were ſo evident, and undenyable a ſeal from the Lord as may force the greateſt Atheiſt to ſilence, for. 1. They were Jewes as much concerned in the Religion of their Fathers as any, who did firſt publish the Goſpel, none more zealous according to the Law then Paul was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion, none alſo could challenge their driving any outward intereſt hereby, ſince perſecution, and bonds, yea, greateſt hazard was that which they could expect. 2. It is clear they walked by no rules of human policy, nor theſe ordinary wayes of inſinuation, which the World doth uſe, to engadge men, and make a party to themſelves, but did deliver the truth, truth moſt repugnant to the flesh, and that intereſt, with greateſt candour, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, though likewiſe with a convincing authority, and confidence, yea, came with a meſſage to the World, which had no other convoy, or perſwading argument, but the evidence of its own truth, but withal, ſuch a power accompanying the ſame, before which men could not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44187:101"/> ſtand. 3. What is published concerning Chriſt by the Evangeliſts, the great works he did, his dying at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with all the ſtupendious circumſtances thereof, and ſigns from Heaven was not a thing done in a corner, but in the publick view of men, which in theſe dayes was moſt notour, and famous, but yet there cannot be produced, one contradictory teſtimony to the truth of theſe relations, by any adverſary of the Goſpel, either at that time, or ſince; ſure the World wanted no malice, and theſe great things were airly published, by the Evangeliſts, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whileſt much of that generation was alive, yet, it is clear, though in a matter of that concernment, which made then ſo great a noiſe, and was at that time putting the earth all in a flame, none was found, either among Iewes or gentils, who could, or durſt put forth a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto to diſcover the leaſt cheat, or falshood, in theſe things atteſted in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel. 4. What ever different partyes, and ſects, did break up with the firſt time of the Church, to opppſe the truth in other things, yet, in this they had all one conſent, that he who was crucified at Ieruſalem, was the Meſſias, and Chriſt, which truely, did witnes the clear irreſiſtible manifeſtation of this truth in theſe times, ſince if there could have been the leaſt ground to challenge any impoſture, or deceit, in this great foundation of the Chriſtian faith, it is more then probable, theſe bitter contentions followed with ſuch animoſity, and heat, and irritation of theſe whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Church in that time, did with much zeall, and sharpeſt cenſures perſue, would have engadged them to put all the diſgrace upon the truth which they could, if they might have had where to faſten their teeth; I would furder adde, that even the arguments and objections, which the adverſaryes of the Goſpel could ever bring, to oppoſe the ſame, are indeed a convincing witneſs, and confirmation, and shew how little they could any way ſay, in giving their malice a vent, we find that abſurd alledgeance of the Iewes that the great works Chriſt did in the dayes of his flesh were by ſtealing the name Iehovah out
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44187:101"/> of the temple, which they alleadge he ſewed up in his thigh, which truely needeth no further refutation but the recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, and, here they are even forced to witnes the truth of theſe relations held forth by the Evangeliſts as to the matter of fact, which we find alſo theſe later Atheiſts ſuch as Vanninus, Cardan, &amp;c. dare not challenge, or debate, onely they would aſcrive theſe great works which Chriſt then wrought, to the influence of the ſtarres, a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ſo abſurd, that needs no other anſwer but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. We have that remarkable prophecy of <hi>the incoming of the Gentils,</hi> a truth indeed great, and marvellous, which as it is expreſly held forth in the Old Teſtament, yea, is there mentioned, <hi>Iſ. 54: ver. 1, 2. Iſ. 60: ver.</hi> 3, 9. is a thing ſo clearly now written forth in the event, that I am ſure, the greateſt Atheiſts can have no shift here, that in this ſtrange work of God about his Church, the Scripture hath an undenyable accomplishment. Now to clear this let us but conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for many ages this truth anent the incalling of the gentils was ſealed up in a prophecy, a thing ſo great, and aſtonishing to the auncient Iewiſh Church that they could not well comprehend the ſame, until once the event brought it forth, for this was indeed a myſtery hid from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, how the Gentiles should be fellow heires, of the ſame body, and partakers of the promiſe in Chriſt, then the bounds, and extent of the Church did not exceed Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea that ſmall incloſure, whileſt the whole World beſide did ly buried like an out field in dark paganiſme, it is well known that the moſt pleaſant places of Africa, Aſia, and Europe, where afterwards many famous Churches were, within theſe 1600 yeares was but a ſavage wildernes, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Germanie, and France, did then vvorship the ſun, and ſtarres, they ſacrificed to the Gods of the heathens, yea, theſe eaſtern partes, on which the ſun did firſt riſe, did not then know the God of Iſrael, a truth which not only
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44187:102"/> the Roman, and Grecian Hiſtoryes, but the records of particular Nations can clearly atteſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is clear that this prophecy was not held forth in a general; but we find the time alſo prefixed (with other ſpecial circumſtances) when it should have its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment at the appearing of the Meſſias, when he should be revealed to Iſrael, before which time a bar was drawen in the way of the Nations, and a wall of partition betwixt them, and the Church, until he ſtand up who should hold forth an enſign to the People, and gather the gentils under his ſtandard, which Eſay doth clearly shew, <hi>Eſ. 11: v. 10. and 34: ver. 1, 2. and 60: ver. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and then muſt the mountaines flow down at his preſence, Nations be born at once, yea, the light break forth to the Eaſt, and the Weſt, then should the Children of the deſolate be moe then of the married wife, when this time, even the ſet time for the gentils is once come, and it may be very convincing, which is indeed obſervable, that notwithſtanding of a more flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing condition, of the Iewish Church in former ages, when her grandour, and proſperity was more tempting, and the neighbourhood, and commerce which the Nations about had with that People, yea, though by the captivity they were ſcattered, among the Perſians, and Babylonians, yet was there no ſtir, or change of the World, until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time once came.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be eaſy to prove the event of this prophecy, and its manifeſt accomplishment, even at the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for this men can not deny, that the Lord did viſit the Gentils with the knowledge of his truth, which then cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a change in the earth, as a great part of it hath been brought from heathnish idolatry to vvorship the God of Iſrael, and ſuch who once were ſtrangers, and aliens, now made to profeſſe the ſame faith (as to the ſubſtance thereof) of the auncient Iewish Church, ſure this truth needs not want a vvitnes, vvhileſt Nations, and much of the knovvn World hath been for ſo long a time, and, yet to this day are a viſible proof thereof, a truth of ſuch concernment that in former ages made a great and ſtupendious change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44187:102"/> the face of the earth, ſo that not onely an innumerable company out of all Nations, and languages, but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, the very complex body of Kingdoms, and Nations can bear vvitnes thereto, novv the Goſpel hath been preached through much of the World, yea, vve may ſay, fevv parts thereof, vvhere there hath not been ſome face of a Church, though the promiſe hath not yet had its full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, but vve wait for (according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) a more flowrishing time, and great harveſt among the Nations, when Iſrael shall be gathered, how ever it is ſure the Lord hath in a great part fulfilled this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo that the Church might then with aſtonishment cry out, who hath begotten all theſe Children, who are theſe that flee as a cloud, like the doves to their windowes? O bleſſed day, in which the light did firſt break up on the poor ofſpring of Iaphet who then dwelt in the shadow, and region of death. O bleſt day that brought ſalvation with it to the gentils, wherein the Lord did viſit theſe dark places of the earth, which were full of the habitations of cruelty, I think the ſenſe of ſo great a mercy, should never let us want an errant for giving thanks, yea, put much to ſilence our other complaints.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is it not alſo clear that not only as to the time, but theſe very places of the earth which Eſai, and other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did particularly point at, this promiſe had an exact accomplishment? for it is this day manifeſt the iſles which we find ſo frequently mentioned, that theſe should wait for his law, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth, whence he should bring th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Daughter of his diſperſed, may have a clear commentar upon the ſame, from what the Lord hath done to Britain, and Ireland with other remote parts of the earth, yea, hath not the Aethiopians been made to ſtretch out their hands, even in theſe ſun-burnt places of Africk, hath not Chriſt alſo had a conqueſt, where many a black moore was through grace made as the ſnow of Salmon, and the feathers of a dove, ſo that it is clear how theſe particular places, which were ſo oft pointed at by the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44187:103"/> Prophets have been viſited by the Goſpel, and fallen to the share of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This change which by the incoming of the gentils to the Church was wrought upon the Earth, is a thing ſo great, and aſtonishing, that were it ſtill in the promiſe, and this not yet fulfilled, it would truely ſtagger our faith, how ſuch a thing should ever come to paſſe, and is there not here a miracle, that the World cannot poſſibly deny? even this great work of God in bringing of the gentils, which without an extraordinary power, could not be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat, if men will conſider. Firſt. That ſvvift progreſſe which then the Goſpel had, how it did run, and was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through the furtheſt parts of the earth, and like a ligtning break forth from one place to another, ſo that in the Apoſtles time, the Scripture doth shew, how moſt of the conſpicuous Provinces of Aſia, had received the Goſpel, and Tertullian who lived in the ſecond Century, in his Book <hi>contra Iudaos</hi> doth there witnes how many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and theſe moſt remote from other, Parthians, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Pamphilia, with much of Egypt, and diverſe parts of Africk, beſides Rome, Spain, and other places of Europe, were in his time almoſt wholly Chriſtian; for it is indeed clear that the bounds of the Church was then of a larger extent then it is now at this day. 2. It is alſo undenyable that in this ſolemn day of the Goſpels ſpreading amongſt the nations, ſuffering, and perſecution did all that time attend the Church, yea, in ſuch a meaſure that as the writers of theſe times do witnes neither famine peſtilence, nor the ſword, did deſtroy ſo many of the World, as then were of Chriſtians in the two firſt centuries put to death for adhering to the truth, and it is clear, that this great work of God in ſuch a ſwift ſpreading of the Church, was moſt diſcernable in theſe times of hotteſt perſecution, yea then was her moſt effectual grouth, and increaſe, which upon her getting ſome reſt, and beginning to flowrish with external peace, was at a viſible ſtand. 3 How marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a thing was this, to be brought about (if we conſider
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44187:103"/> the many different languages, that did then ſtop correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the Church and the reſt of the earth, for how could the truth thus ſpread among the nations, yea, in ſuch remote places of the World Churches be planted by the Apoſtles, and have the Scripture tranſlated, and made legible to them without that extraordinary gift of tongues, which for that end was then given from the Lord? ſure beſide ſacred authority anent this, reaſon may convincingly witnes to the World the truth of ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. 4. How ſtrange, and wonderful a change was this, that in ſo short a time the Goſpel should thus enlighten, and put ſuch a luſtre on the moſt rude, and ſavage places of the earth, where ſcarſe humanity had been, and bring them from the condition of beaſts to men, should thus tame, and civilize the greateſt Barbarians, and cauſe the lion to ly down with the lamb, yea, by the preaching of that Goſpel, and of a crucified Chriſt, which as it was to the Jewes a ſtumbling block, ſo to the Greeks foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes.</p>
                  <p>And in a word was not this indeed a miracle how in a mattet of ſuch high concernment as that vvherein mens ſoul, and everlaſting intereſt lay they should be turned off their old vvay, and Religion, in vvhich they, and their Fathers had been ſo long rooted, &amp; that a little ſpark which did break up in Iudea, should bring dovvn the idols of the nations, and burn up their temples.</p>
                  <p>Alace that there is ſo little of a large heart, of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive zeal, and fervour this day among Chriſtians for the enlargement of the Church, that ſuch merchants are now rare who would venture out to trade with other parts, for this excellent ware, the merchandiſe whereof is better then of gold. O that in theſe parts where the truth is knovvn and profeſſed, the Lord vvould raiſe up men of ſuch a ſpirit, and ſuch a Magiſtrat, vvho vvould make it their vvork, and lay dovvn ſolid grounds hovv to advance the Kingdome of Chriſt in the dark places of the earth, and reckon their intereſt in a forrain plantation upon the account
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44187:104"/> of the Goſpel, no leſſe then on the account of trade, vve vvould pray, and yet hope for this.</p>

What vve find foretold by Daniel, yea, by Chriſt himſelf anent <hi>the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and ceaſing of the Iewish dayly ſacrifice with the rejection of that people, Dan. 12. ver. 11. Matth. 24: ver. 2.</hi> hath many ages paſt come to paſſe, wherein the World may ſee how clearly the event doth anſwer this Prophecy, for it is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is a truth which doth need no other witnes, then the ſcattered remnant, and deſolate ruines of that once flowrishing Church, and nation of the Iewes vvhich vve ſee vvith our eyes at this day, vvhoſe preſent ſtate is ſo great a monument of divine judgement, ſo clear a vvitnes to the Scripture that I think men cannot look thereon, if they be in any meaſure ſerious, but muſt have ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What hath befallen this people may it not be an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to the World in all ſucceeding ages? a ſtroke that hath put them in a more ſad condition, then any nation, or people we ever yet heard of, that hath caſt them out of their own land, ſcattered them as vagabonds through the earth, ſo that theſe many ages they have had no ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor Law-giver, no piece of the earth they can call their own, but at the mercy, and arbitrary diſpoſal of every place they reſide in, no priviledge, or liberties but a naked permiſſion to brook their lives, and eſtates during the pleaſure of theſe under whom they get shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a people put by themſelves with a viſible mark of divine wrath upon them, like a beacon ſet up for all the nations to look on, even theſe who were once eminently ovvned of the Lord, who was known in their palaces for a refuge, yea, it is very manifeſt that no ſtir or eſſay that ever they made for their releef, but was ſtill to their further ruin, and found Gods hand viſibly croſſe to them therein; ſure Ammianus Marcellinus, a heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did intend no teſtimony to the Chriſtian cauſe in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <p n="3">3. Muſt it not be ſome ſtrange, and dreadful provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, beyond the ſin of their forefathers, whereat ſo ſtrange, and unuſual a ſtroke doth point? whileſt it is clear that notwithſtanding frequent Idolatry, and departing from God when they were at that height in wickednes to offer up their children to Molech, and ſet up altars in the groves, to reject the meſſage of the prophets, and thruſt ſome of them in a dungeon, yet, were only punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed with 70 yeares captivity, and after by Gods very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat hand brought again, theſe who had taken them captive concurring with them to rebuild the temple: but now how long and dark hath their night been ſince this judgement came on them, and though they could not theſe many ages charge themſelves with Idolatry, yet no ſaviour or deliverer hath been raiſed up, no Prophet ſent forth, no ſign or appearance at this day of releef, now for theſe 1600 yeares, yea amidſt theſe frequent changes and revolutions that have been in the World no change in their condition, ſure if that people vvere in ſpeaking tearmes with their conſciences, this might put them to a ſtrange demurr, what should be the cauſe if they be not guilty of killing the Meſſias, and that blood purſuing them; what attrocious provocation beyond others they can condeſcend on, for which the Lord doth ſo long and ſo ſore by ſuch an unuſual, and unheard of ſtrok thus contend.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What a marvellous concurrence of providence, and convincing appearance of a divine hand was in this jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, the beſieging of Ieruſalem by the Romans tryſted with the very time of the paſſover whileſt ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of people from all parts of the land were there on that account, that both ſword, and famine might contribute

                  <p n="5">5. But it is here we may ſee a ſingular providence of God for his Church, that theſe who of all the World are moſt violent enemyes to the Chriſtian truth, are alſo a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing vvitnes to the ſame, vvhileſt, firſt, theſe do clearly atteſt the Scripture (vvhich is our alone charter) the divine authority of Moſes, and the Prophets, the true copyes vvhereof, they did moſt tenderly preſerve vvhat ever abſurd gloſſes ſome of their Rabbies have thereon.

Yea, in this we may appeal the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt to his conſcience that the Scripture is no impoſture, or any cunning device of Chriſtians which is ſo far witneſſed even by the greateſt adverſary, and maligners of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. 2. That ſtrange induration of the Iewes, their unreaſonable rejecting of the truth, vvho after ſo long a time cannot ſee the cauſe vvhich is moſt diſcernable in their ſtroke. O is not this alſo a moſt convincing ſeal to the Scripture, and clear fulfilling thereof that there is a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44187:105"/> vail over their mind as the Apoſtle sheweth, whileſt they read the Law, judicially ſmitten by the Lord with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that they cannot ſee until once this vail be taken off, and truely we may ſay there is nothing in their judgement more ſtrange and aſtonishing then ſuch a continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy againſt the truth, how they should be thus dark in the noon day. But that herein the Scripture is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; ſo that we may even turn a poiſon unto an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidot.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. That which is ſo expreſly foretold in the New Teſtament, yea, is the great drift of the Prophecyes thereof, <hi>The coming of Antichriſt, and revealing of the man of ſin to the World, 2 Thiſſ. 2: ver.</hi> 3, 4, 7, 8, 9. hath long ſince been accomplished, wherein we may, ſay the wonderful correſponding of the event with the prophecy is ſo clear, that this truth is novv as plain, and obvious as once it was dark to the Church, theſe things being undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How the Spirit of God in the Scripture hath been in a more then ordinary way particular, to point Antichriſt forth by ſuch notour marks, and characters, that after ages may known him, if they will not shut their eyes, I confeſſe it is not ſtrange the popish party should ſeal-up the Scripture, and forbid the ordinary reading of it; ſince the breaking forth of that light vvould ſoon make their Kingdome dark, for if men vvould but ſet the hiſtory of the Church ſince the times of the Apoſtles, over againſt the Scripture, and make uſe of that notable key for opening up the prophecyes of the Nevv Teſtament it should be then eaſy to knovv, the Antichriſt is ſurely come, and vvho this is, and herein doth the Lords tender reſpect to his Church appear, that he doth not only in a very ſolemn manner, forevvarn men, anent this great trya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44187:106"/> doth alſo make ſo clear a diſcovery of the whole fabrick, riſe, and progres of that party, with ſuch particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and differencing characters from any other enemy of the Church, as may render the World moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, if they will needs dash on that rock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture, hath ſet ſo conſpicuous a beacon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this Prophecy should now want an accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Antichriſt be yet to come is a thing moſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſacred truth, ſince it is ſure, that myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity even in the times of the Apoſtles did begin to work, and he who then for a time withheld his coming, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Empire of Rome, hath long ſince been taken out of the way, which cauſed ſome Chriſtians in theſe dayes wish the ſtanding, and continuance of that Empire, from the terrour they had of that adverſary who according to the word they knew was to fill his room, yea, doe we not find the Churches tryal from Antichriſt should be the moſt ſore, and laſting tryal of the Church under the New Teſtament, which after her begun breathing from heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish perſecution, was to continue for many ages wherein the word is moſt expreſſe, and cleir, that the riſe, and fall of this enemy should be gradual, and not at once, whoſe beginning, and firſt appearance might be traced to the firſt times of the Church, and his cloſe, and finall run near the ſecond coming of Chriſt, by the brightnes whereof he shall be deſtroyed, and therefore, this is ſo much the ſubject of the Prophecyes of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the great intent, and ſcope of the Revelation of Iohn, in which, the true ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, with the various changes of her condition, even from the opening up of the firſt ſeal to the blowing of the laſt trumpet, is particularly held forth, and there may we all alongſt trace the ſteps of the riſe, and fall of that man of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſuch an one as the Scripture points forth, who doth moſt fully anſwer to all theſe marks which are there given of Antichriſt, hath come, and been revealed to the World, is a thing ſo very manifeſt that except men will
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44187:106"/> needs force their light, and conſcience it cannot but be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond queſtion, and debate, even ſuch an one whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be after the working of Satan with all power, ſignes, and lying wonders, forbidding to marry, and to abſtain from meats which God had appointed, who ſitteth in the temple of God, having a name full of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and doth exalt himſelfe above all that is called God, who bewitcheth the Kings, and great men of the earth with his enchantements, yea, even by his livery may he be known that he moſt uſually hath ſcarlet, and purple, which I think truely marvellous how particularly theſe are mentioned in the Scripture; and in a word, ſuch an one whoſe traffick, and merchandize, is not only gold, and ſilver but the ſouls of men, who should be drunk with the blood of the Saints, and martyres of Jeſus Chriſt, under whoſe reign the Church muſt flee to the wildernes, and there be latent for a long time, and his ſeat, that city which is ſituat upon 7 hills, even that great city which doth rule over the Kings of the earth. O ſtrange how men can acknowledge this for the Scripture of God, and yet not ſee it fulfilled before their eyes, that there is ſo vive an image, and portraicture of Antichriſt there held forth, ſuch peculiar characters which do convincingly point at the Pope, and popish hierarchy, yea could anſwer to no other adverſary which Chriſt ever had under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, either pagan, or Mahumetan, and yet ſo much of the World doth not know him when he is before their eyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is clear that no age ſince Antichriſt was revealed, did altogether want ſome witnes, to point him forth, even in the darkeſt times, many of whom loved not their lives unto the death that they might ſeal this truth, and it may be a queſtion if more of the blood of the Saints, was shed under heathens then in after times under Antichriſt, yea, though we had not ſuch expreſſe marks to diſover him from the word, it may be eaſy for men to judge, who that is, who is this day ſo directly oppoſire to Jeſus Chriſt, and the great deſign of the Goſpel, that aſſumes to himſelfe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44187:107"/> what is alone due to God, to forgive ſin, and be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with Religious adoration, doth challenge a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial power, and ſupremacy, over the whole Church as its head, a ſtyle too great for any of the Angels, who maketh void the merit of Chriſt, and layeth down a way of life, and ſalvation, on the ſame termes that it ſtood in the Covenant of works, doth deſtroy the great intent of the Goſpel, and in effect denyeth Ieſus Chriſt to have come in the flesh, who ſetteth Heaven upon ſale for money, and permitteth none to perish and goe to hell, but the poore, doth diſpence with the groſſeſt acts of ſin and the expres commands of the Law-giver, maketh moral prohibitions void by his authority, yea, halloweth the very ſtewes, and moſt horrid acts of uncleannes, taketh on him to change the condition of the dead, and enſure to their friends, the happy ſtate of their ſouls, if they will make large offerings on that account, O! who is this, is not that Antichriſt, whoſe way doth ſtate him in ſuch direct tearmes of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Have we not cauſe to wonder no leſſe at the ſtrange induration, and blindnes, of the popish party, then of the Iewes, that whileſt the one doth confeſſe the Old Teſtament; and yet knoweth not Chriſt, the other should grant the truth of the New Teſtament, and not know An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, that he is come, even he after whom a great piece of the World, for theſe many ages hath been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, ſure ſo clear an agreement betwixt this prophecy and the event may not only put this beyond debate, but leave a conviction, upon the greateſt Atheiſts, of the truth, and divinity of the Scripture, for what ever former times might pretend ignorance whileſt this myſtery was but working, now when the man of ſin hath comed to his full height, and ſtature, and ſo clearly revealed by the light of the Goſpel, it taketh away all excuſe, and I profeſſe in theſe latter times, I cannot ſee how one can be a knowing Papiſt, and not an Atheiſt alſo.</p>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:44187:107"/>X, What was prophecyed anent <hi>the killing of the witneſſes under Antichrist, Rev. 11: v.</hi> 3, 7, 8. we may ſay hath clearly comed to paſſe, and at this day may read the ſame, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for it is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That dureing Antichriſts reigne even in the darkeſt times, there wanted not ſome to ſeal the truth, and bear witnes thereto, both by open confeſſion, and ſuffering on that account, which the Church Hiſtories can aboundantly make out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That dureiug that dark night theſe who did give a teſtimony, and any way appeared, againſt the grievous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of Antichriſts in behalf of down-born truth, were put to prophecy in ſackcloth, when there was nothing left, but to weep, over the Churches ruines, and witnes their deteſtation, and grief, for the growing Apoſtacy of ſuch times.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is clear, that as the prophecy doth point at ſome more remarkable ſuffering, and perſecution, which the Church was to meet with from Antichriſt, beyond all it had endured from that adverſary in former ages, yea, a ſpecial permiſſion from the Lord to that party, to vent their rage and cruelty againſt the Saints, which should fall out after the witneſſes finishing their teſtimony, who had ſo long in an abject, low condition, as in ſackcloth prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed yea, when Antichriſt should be at his height, and his Kingdome upon the turn, that then muſt this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable killing of the witneſſes be accomplished; ſo, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did the event convincingly verify the ſame, for it is knowen that upon the cloſe of Antichriſts reigne, whileſt the truth began to break up, this ſoreſt ſtorme of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond all that had been before, did then break upon the Church, even in its budding forth, that we may ſay, that adverſary did not onely put forth the outmoſt of his power, and rage againſt the Saints, but ſeemed in ſome meaſure to bring his cruel deſignes to paſſe, which, the dreadful maſſacres in France, Province, and the Valleys of Piemont, the ſore and violent perſecution of the Church
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44187:108"/> through the Netherlands, under the Duke of Alba, and in England by Queen Mary, in Germany after the defeat of the Duke of Saxony, and Landgrave of Heſſe can clearly witnes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is it not alſo clear, how this remarkable ſtorm, and cutting down of the Saints, over whoſe dead bodyes their adverſaryes did rejoyce, was according to this prophecy to be previous to ſome eminent enlargement, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Church, which did accordingly fall out in the event like a reſurrection of the witneſſes from the dead, to the aſtonishment of the World, that immediatly followed upon the back thereof, ſo that when their enemyes thought they had gained their end, as they did conclude by ſuch perſecutions, particularly that French maſſacre that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant intereſt, should be quite ruined, they were forced to ſee their labour in vain, and the Church more eminently flowrishing after the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I shall but furder adde that Antichriſt hath not only been revealed, and his Kingdome come to its height, but it is clear this day that it is on the falling hand, and his ruine is now begun, upon which account we may ſay, yea, have cauſe to ſing that the winter is paſt, the fig tree putteth forth her leaves that sheweth the ſommers approach, yea, the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of birds is heard in our land let us go forth, and meet him who is now gone out as a mighty man, for the ſalvation of his Church, and taken the fields againſt this great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of his truth and people, on whoſe ſide victory doth ſurely wait.</p>

                  <p>HAving touched a little ſome of the moſt concerning prophecyes of the Scripture, both under the New &amp; Old Teſtament, which are already fulfilled, and the truth
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44187:108"/> thereof ſo clearly written forth in the hiſtory of providence, that we may ſay the moſt ordinary obſervers if they will not shut their eyes, cannot want a conviction thereof, I shall now in the next place point at that which yet remaineth of the prophetical part of the Scripture, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, theſe prophecyes which concern the Church in theſe laſt times, whereby we may have a ſure demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how far the night is ſpent, and of the near approach of that bleſſed day, of the liberty of the ſonnes of God, for this doth finish the myſtery of God, and fully perfecteth his work, if once that which remaineth of the prophecyes of the word were fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>There are theſe truths the accomplishment whereof we have a ſure warrant to expect before the end; Firſt, the full ruin, and downfal of Babylon. 2. The converſion, and incalling of the Jewes to Jeſus Chriſt. 3. A ſolemn day of the Churches flowrishing, both Iewes, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which shall follow the outmaking of the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. 4. The fall, and deſtruction of the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that cruel party who hath been raiſed up, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for judgement, with whom the Lord shall yet rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon, for all that Chriſtian blood by them, ſo unjuſtly shed, ſeemeth clearly held forth, <hi>Rev. 16: ver.</hi> 12. 5. We are alſo to expect after all theſe, that full, and laſt ſtroke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gog, and Magog, and then the Lord is at hand, and that great myſtery of the prophecyes, and promiſes of the Scripture, shall then be finished, and at a bleſſed cloſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. We have <hi>the full ruin and deſtruction of Antichriſt, and his Kingdome,</hi> clearly prophecyed, and in very expreſſe tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes promiſed to the Church, 2 <hi>Theſſ 2: ver. 2 8.

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:44187:109"/>1. That this judgement is already begun and the firſt ſtep thereof viſible, is now clear, wherein men may ſee the event moſt exactly anſwer the prophecy, for the Lord hath begun to conſume Antichriſt by the breath of his mouth, and ſince the firſt breaking up of the light, his Kingdome hath been mouldering down before the Word, hath not Nations fallen off at the voice of the preached Goſpel? It is true the Church wanteth not ſore con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>licts, even under the <hi>Vials,</hi> and it is the Lords way to try his People with ſuch various uncertainties, that when things have been moſt promiſing, another providence cometh like a croſſe wave, which ſeemeth to drive them as far back as once they ſeemed to be forward, yet, it is ſure, and should be beyond debate, that Antichriſts overthrow is upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent advance, and that work of the Lord for his Churches deliverance, is going fordward, for if we believe ſalvation by Chriſt upon the warrant of the word, should we not alſo with much aſſurance believe that Antichriſts wound is deadly, and incurable, which he hath got by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, which all the Phyſitians of the earth shall never help.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is one of the greateſt, and ſignal actes of the judgement of God, on his Churches enemyes, one of the moſt eminent manifeſtations of his glory which he hath reſerved for the laſt times, wherein, the appearance of his hand, and great power shall be very manifeſt, and we are to expect by this remarkable ſtroak, that way shall be made for that glorious houſe, which Chriſt is to have for himſelf in the latter dayes, which shall be built upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts ruines, when that new bride both of Iewes, and Gentiles, shall be prepared for the marriage ſupper of the Lamb.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though we are to expect on clear ground from the word, the Lords eminent appearing by his immediat hand in this great work which shall be ſo convincing in that day, and witnes an extraordinary providence, that all onlookers muſt with fear and aſtonishment confeſſe that this is Gods own work, yet, it is alſo clear, that he will therein make
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44187:109"/> uſe of inſtruments fitted, and choſen for that end, who shall be raiſed, and acted forth with a more then ordinary Spirit, to execute the vengeance of the Lord, even the judgement written, amongſt whom the feeble shall then be ſtrong, yea, we have ground to expect, that of the Kings of rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="4">4. We are not to bound the Lord, as to any particular time for accomplishing this piece of his word, yet, we have clear ground to believe that Babylons ruin maketh haſt, and the day of the Lord upon her is near, whoſe ſword is bathed in Heaven, and that the inſtruments of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance are making ready, one ſtroke upon that party is already paſt, Antichriſt hath begun to fall before the word, and muſt fall further until that great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The many prayers of the ſaints, vvhich are novv before the throne, and cannot want a return, many who wreſtled oft with the Lord on this accompt, though they are away, yet, are their prayers to the fore, and waits for this ſolemn manifeſtation of the judgement of God, and the blood of the Saints doth not ceaſe to cry, yea, hath as loud a cry as ever. 2. It is clear that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ached Goſpel now ſince the light began to break forth doth ripen, and help to make the harveſt more white then many ages formerly, and truely if we conſider how long the word hath been ſounding a retreat to that party to come out of Babylon, and that for theſe 150 Years they have been ſtill acting in oppoſition to ſo clear a light, to ſuch a ſolemn call, ſo many warnings, yea, to ſuch convincing diſcovery of the Lords being againſt them in very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providences, doth it not shew, at what an height
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44187:110"/> their ſin this day is, and an obſtinat rejecting of cure? 3. We cannot but ſee, how that judgement which should be poured forth on Antichriſt under the vials, is in a great meaſure now verifyed in the event. 4. It is clear, and conſonant to the Scripture, that the Lords work is now haſtening in the latter dayes, providence in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="1">1. That this promiſe doth not onely concern particular perſons, or a few, but the body, and generality of that people, is moſt clear from the Scripture, if men would compare <hi>Iſai. 11: ver. 11.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1. That theſe great promiſes which hold forth ſo eminent an enlargement, and flowrishing of the Church, do alſo point at ſome particular limited time, ſome period, and revolution of the Churches condition, which is not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and common to other times, until which theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do not take place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This promiſed flowrishing concerneth both Jewes, and Gentiles, and the word doth clearly point at ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſe of the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3.

                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:44187:112"/>4. It would appear ſo ſolemn a time of the Churches flowrishing whereat the Prophets did ſo oft point, as it hath an undoubted reſpect to the dayes of the Goſpel, ſo in its full accomplishment muſt anſwer to that remarkable day of Satans binding, and the Saints Reigne with Chriſt, when the Kingdoms of the Earth become the Lords, which we find doth immediatly preceede Satans laſt louſing, and his going forth to gather his broken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for that great battle which is to be very near the end.</p>
                  <p>I shall but adde we have ground to judge the Lord will usher in that glorious, everlaſting ſtate of the Church, even by ſome preparative degrees here, the latter times are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be reckoned the more bleſſed, the more near they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the dawning of glory.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place I shall but point at ſomethings which with a ſafe warrant, we may underſtand, and look after, in the accomplishment of theſe promiſes.</p>
                  <p>It is very clear they hold forth a great enlargement to the univerſal Church both of Jewes, and Gentiles, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches may be in a ſad withering condition whileſt other parts do flowrish, but theſe promiſes ſeem to point at a day, which will concern the Saints in all corners of the earth, who shall not want their share with the reſt of that bleſſed time, it may be alſo clear, ſome more bright, and hot ſun-shine of the Goſpel is held forth, ſome ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſpringtide of the Spirit that shall be as diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the Churches low ebb ſometime was, a day of the great power of God, his preſence very manifeſt among his people, and with the ordinances, beyond former times ſo that <hi>Ezek. 48: ver. 35.</hi> the name of that place shall be called Iehovah Shammah, the Lord is there, yea, that in this day Chriſts viſible Kingdome in a ſetled Church ſtate shall more eminently flowrish, and the flowing in of people and nations with much fervour, who shall joyn themſelves to the Lord, pure ordinances, a more univerſal oneneſſe amongſt the worshippers of God, the walk of Chriſtians with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44187:113"/> luſtre of holines, made to commend the Goſpel, Chriſts goings full of Majeſty, and the shout of a King which then shall be heard among his People, the noyſe of ſuch ſad complaints, and bitter exerciſes from the ſpirit of bondage, not ſo much among the Saints as in former times, and though we ſee no ſure ground from the word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a favourable time wherein the Church militant shall not have trouble and perſecution from the World, yet, there ſeemeth ſo much clearly imported in ſome of theſe great promiſes, as point at a greater calm, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable gale of outward proſperity, which the Church shall then have, yea, this in ſome longer continuance then in former ages, a day wherein the haters of the Lord shall even be made to feign ſubjection with much of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and concurrence of Magiſtrates, and the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in behalfe of the Church, yea, a time of much holy fear amongſt the people of God, and of much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and aw upon his enemies, to which the great works of the Lord in that time shall then effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute and cauſe them fear the Lord, and his goodneſſe in the latter dayes.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We have a prophecy held forth, <hi>Rev. 16: ver.</hi> 12. which comparing with <hi>Rev. 9: ver. 13.</hi> ſeemeth clearly to point at <hi>the fall, and deſtruction of the Turkish Empire</hi> who have been theſe many ages ſo great a ſcourge to the Chriſtian World, for it is manifeſt that this drying up of the river of Euphrates muſt relate to that very party which we find in that 9 Chap, raiſed up from about that river where the Turk hath ſo conſiderable a part of his dominions, it is true the event will more clearly make this known, yet theſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſuch a party was foretold by John in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at 9 Chap. and a ſolemn warning given to the Church of ſo dreadfull a ſtorm, the time alſo there pointed forth when Antichriſt should be at a great height, yea, the portraicture of ſuch an adverſary moſt evidently held forth, ſuch as indeed they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44187:113"/> were found to be, a terrible cruell deſtroying party, and therefore are ſaid to have breaſtplates of fire, their number alſo there held out to be a very great multitude, which theſe huge armyes uſually brought by the Turk to the field, can witnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The cauſe why the Lord should raiſe up ſo dreadful an enemy, and thus let them louſe, is alſo expreſly declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that 9 Cha. 20 ver. that it was in judgement, and for a plague on men for Antichriſtian idolatry, which then had ſo much overſpread the earth, and it was no wonder, that when ſo much of the viſible Church was turned almoſt bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish in their Religion, and from the pure worship of God, was caried after idols of gold, and ſilver, the work of mens hands that ſo brutish, and barbarous an adverſary should be let out for a ſcourge; I truely think that as Antichriſt, and the abominations of that party hath been hitherto the lett of ſucceſſe againſt the Turk; ſo we are not to expect the proſpering of any ſuch deſign, and his fall, and ruin, until the cauſe be removed, for which the Lord did make uſe of this dreadful rod.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſuch a party was raiſed up according to the prophecy, yea, at the appointed time thereof, is very clear, who like a mighty deluge did overflow a great piece of the earth, and with ſtrange prodigious ſucceſſe, did overrun much of Aſia, ſome parts of Africk, and brake in on Europe to give work to theſe kings, and great men, and be a ſcourge to them who had given their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to uphold the throne of the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is alſo clear ground from the Scripture that the Lord shall as eminently appear in the fall, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this adverſary as in the raiſing of them up, and that by their fall, he is to make way for the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of his promiſe, anent the Churches further encreaſe, his perfecting the fulnes of the Gentiles, and bringing in his auncient people, whereto this prophecy ſeems to have a particular reſpect, this we are to look after as one of the great works of the Lord that is reſerved for the latter dayes which shall no leſſe shew forth his power and glory,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44187:114"/> even the drying up of that great Euphrates, then in the day that he divided the ſea, and made Iordan a dry channel for his people to go through, we are not to be furder poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anent means, and inſtruments how ſuch a thing shall be brought about, it is eneugh what the Lord hath ſpoken, and the word that is gone out of his mouth shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in vain.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Now to cloſe this, there is yet one great aſſault which we find the Church shall have before the end, and then her warfare will be near finished, anent which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is clear, that Sathan for a little muſt be let louſe, and that ſolemn and perfect victory, which the Church in the cloſe of time will get over all her adverſaries, shall be ushered in with a very sharp tryal, and once again this ungodly World will shew its rage, ralley its broken ſcattered forces, in a general muſter Rev. 20: 8. with as much fury as ever, and there shall the Lord emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear, that by one full ſtroke he may for ever decide that long continued war, and feed betwixt the Church, and her enemyes, a deliverance which as it will be the laſt, ſo one of the greateſt, that ever the Church had, the Lord thus finishing his work of providence by ſo ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and magnificent a cloſe; and truely after this we know no more of Canonick Scripture to be fulfilled but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord, when the poor, toſt, afflicted Church, shall enter unto a triumphant eſtate above all the violence, and oppreſſion of men. O bleſſed, and long looked for day, of Chriſts return to judgement, when the duſt of the Saints that for ſome thouſand yeares paſt have been reſting in hope, shall awake, and this earth, and all the glory thereof like a poor vain shew diſappear? O bleſſed, and comfortable time in which the ſaints shall then fully know what Heaven is, which they have ſo oft admired at a diſtance, to behold his face in whoſe preſence is fulnes of joy, and shall need no further confirmations of the truth of the word, when once this great promiſe of the Lords return is verifyed, a promiſe, wherein all theſe pretious
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44187:114"/> truths which concerned the Church in her journey as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtreames, shall empty themſelves in this great deep, then there is no more to do, the work of the Goſpel is finished, the redeemed all brought in, and the Bride made ready to go forth and meet him, who shall fully ſatiſfy, and comfort his People, according to the dayes of their former affliction, and be for ever their exceeding great reward.</p>

               <p>It is ſure that a part of the Scripture ſome ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes, which do concern the ſtate of the Church in theſe laſt times, hath not yet had an accomplishment, which are already touched in the former argument, and are indeed ſo great concerning truths, that may cauſe us ſit down, and wonder, when we think theſe shall shortly come to paſſe; yet ſuch, whereof we may be fully perſwaded, if we conſider that they are held forth, and promiſed, by him who is the God of truth, and the begun performance thereof, now ſo manifeſt, yea what hath been the Lords way, and the eminent providences of theſe laſt times which may fully ſatiſfy our ſpirits that Gods work is near to a cloſe, and the accomplishing of the whole Scripture now at hand.</p>
               <p>I shall here point at 3 ſpecial grounds whence the godly in theſe times may be throughly confirmed anent the truth, and certain out making of the Scripture, and theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44187:115"/> thereof, that yet are not fulfilled, which we should look on, as a very convincing pledge in our hand of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Ground whence we may be thus confirmed in our faith is this; that not only the moſt part of the Scripture is already proved, and verifyed in the event, but alſo, <hi>Theſe truths which of the whole Scripture, are most ſtrange, and marvellous, yea, should have much ſtaggered our faith if they were yet ſtill in a promiſe are this day certainly accomplished,</hi> I shall but only inſtance <hi>the comming of the Meſſias,</hi> which the Prophets of old foretold, that God should be manifeſt in the flesh, and a virgin bring forth a ſon, whoſe name should be Emmanuel, that was to dye, and be cut off out of the land of the living, not for himſelf but for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his People, is not this now ſurely accomplished<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Which we may ſay is the greateſt wonder, the moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing thing that ever was, or shall be, and should fully ſilence our thoughts, anent any other Scripture truth, that is yet to be made out, for we now know that the great buſſines of redemption is put to a cloſe, the ranſome and price thereof fully told down, now is the doctrine of the Goſpel ſealed, and atteſted by blood even the blood of the Teſtator, it is now ſure the promiſed Meſſias hath come, and this is he, who in the dayes of Pilat ſuffered at Jeruſalem, in whom all things which were written by the Prophets, were truly accomplished. And is not this a great pledge, to aſſure us of the real outmaking of every other promiſe? It is ſure he did dye, his bleſſed ſide was pierced with a ſpear, and upon the croſſe he cryed with a loud voice and gave up the ghoſt. O Here lyeth the greateſt cauſe of wonder, not what doth yet remain of the Scripture but that which is already fulfilled, not that Chriſt should come again to judge the World, but that once he did come to the World, and become man; for God to be found in the form of a ſervant and dye, that is beyond expreſſion wonderful, for the other muſt neceſſarly as a conſequent follow, that he who hath redeemed the

And how may we not with as much aſſurance, wait for the ſecond coming of the Lord, and a full perfecting of his word even from that which is already verifyed thereof, as we are ſure of the return of the ſun after it is gone down, and of the breaking of the day when once the night is paſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Ground whence the godly in theſe times should be confirmed, anent the full performance of that which is yet remaining of the Scripture, that it is ſure, yea, now near at hand, is this, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come to action against the enemies of his Church, and hath taken the fields, that ſurely he is now gone forth in the greatnes of his ſtrength conquering, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:44187:116"/>
               <p>This is a grave truth vvhich might give us very ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing thoughts in ſo shaking a time that whileſt we have ſeen the Lords appearing by a great, and outſtretched hand for his people, theſe terrible ſtirrs, and concuſſions of the nations, have ſeen him ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath, and fill the place with the dead bodye of his adverſaryes, we may alſo on clear Scripture grounds conclude, that the Lord is now awaked as a mighty man, and upon the fields, yea, that the war is ſurely begun againſt Antichriſt, and all the adverſaryes of his Church, which shall not ceaſe until the full victory be obtained, for indeed theſe providences which in theſe laſt times, should be very affrighting, and terrible, when we go in to the word, we shall find they have a comfortable aſpect on the Church, and do preſage her greater enlargement, which as the tender buds, and leaves of the fig tree, are put forth to shew the ſommers approach, <hi>Luc. 21: ver.</hi> 28. it is true the Church is now low, and the work of God meets with very ſad interruptions which are needful, both for tryal, and rebuke, but this alſo is ſure which none can deny, that the Lord hath eminently appeared, and done great things for his Church, yea, we muſt ſay, he hath, by a confluence of very remarkable providences, thus condeſcended to ſtrengthen his peoples hands, to confirm ſuch who are ready to ſtagger, even as it were by cruch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, anent the greatnes of theſe things which are yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>Now to clear this truth a little we would conſider. Firſt, How it is very conſonant to the Scripture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly held forth in the ſame, that in the laſt times, and turn of the Churches caſe from Antichriſt, the Lord will thus appear, in his great ſtrength, and ſet up his ſtandard againſt his adverſaryes, yea, will then in a ſpecial way call forth his people, to glorify him by an active teſtimony. 2. That the Lord hath thus begun to appear according to his word is a truth that is alſo undenyable, &amp; should much help to confirm our faith, anent the performance of that which further remains of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:44187:116"/>1. That this is manifeſt from the word may be thus clear. Firſt, Though the Church militant muſt not want an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and ſome perſecution from the World, even in her beſt eſtate, yet, we have a ſafe warrant to expect that the Lord will glorify himſelfe in a peculiar way in his people now in theſe latter dayes, by doing, and acting for the truth, as in former ages his glory did moſt appear, dnreing Antichriſts Reign, in his Churches ſuffering; for then the faith, and patience of his Saints was to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed in its ſeaſon, <hi>Rev. 13: ver.</hi> 10. and thus he would ſerve himſelfe of his people, and bring forth his glory, until that time of retribution, when theſe who had killed with the ſword, should be killed by the ſword, and theſe who led unto captivity, be ſo dealt with, which doth alſo clearly promiſe ſome ſpecial outletting of the Spirit for acting with theſe gifts of courage, and reſolution ſutable to the ſervice of the Church in the latter dayes, and truely I think it is a great want we ſtudy not more the accomplishing of the promiſes, and how to improve the ſame for gifts, as well as grace in order to the ſeveral times, and neceſſities of the Church.</p>

It is very clear from the Scripture that in the laſt dayes, when Chriſt is to raiſe his Church from under the power, and tyranny of Antichriſt he shall then appear in a warlike poſture, which John had shewed to him, <hi>Rev. 19: v.</hi> 13, 14. as one upon the head of his forces, with his veſture dipped in blood, to shew that vvhen once the vvar is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, againſt his adverſary, and this Lyon of the tribe of Juda begins to rouze himſelfe up, vvhat a terrible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he vvil have in that undertaking, and it is clear, that the Lord hath declared in this his counſel, and vvill, that his Son Chriſt should in the latter times, take unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his great povver, and reign, <hi>Rev. 11: ver.</hi> 17. yea, cauſe the World knovv him to be Head of principalityes, and povvers, as vvell as of the Church, for his glory in this truth as a King, which former ages ſeemed in ſo great a meaſure to darken, muſt then clearly shine forth. I true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think mens appearing with ſuch violence, and rage
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44187:117"/> againſt ſo concerning a truth, now in theſe dayes doth promiſe ſome eminent appearance of the Lord therein, and that he shall yet more ſolemnly aſſert the ſame before the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth not the Scripture point at the laſt times, as that ſpecial time of recompence for the controverſy of Sion to which the Lord hath reſerved a ſolemn triumph of his juſtice, over all his Churches enemyes, when he shall enquire for the blood of his Saints, shed upon the earth ſince the dayes of Abel, at Babylons hand, <hi>Revelat. 18: ver. 24.</hi> that great adverſary, who ſtands in law guilty, and hath ſerved her ſelfe heire to all the violence &amp; cruelty done in former ages, for in her hand muſt that cup be found full which the enemyes of the Church, from the beginning hath been filling up, and as ſo many rivers, and fountaines hath run unto this great ſea.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo clear that in the laſt times, when the Lord shall bind up the breach of his people, and heal the ſtroke of their wound, who, for ſo long a time, had been trampled under by Antichriſt, he shall by ſome ſignal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences roll away this reproach, and ſcandal of meannes, contempt, and perſecution, shall put ſome glory on his Church proportionable to its former abaſement, yea, thus comfort her, according to the dayes, wherein he had afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, and cauſe his peoples upriſing, in meaſure, and kind to anſwer their low, and ſuffering ſtate from Antichriſt, even in the laſt times, when the Lord shall make them appear with the face of a Lion, when the feeble shall be as David, and as the Angel of the Lord, <hi>Zach. 12: ver. 8.</hi> which promiſe doth clearly point at the Churches raiſing, and delivery from Antichriſt; upon the back where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we find the Prophet doth foretel the laſt converſion, and incomming of Iſrael.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I shall only adde what the Scripture doth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly shew, that the Lord shall ſo gloriouſly appear in bringing his Church out of Babylon, and executing his judgement on that adverſary, as in the day when he brought his people out of Egypt, and therefore shall they ſing, the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44187:117"/> ſong of Moſes, and the lamb, <hi>Rev. 15: ver. 3.</hi> his great power, and outſtretched hand, being no leſſe diſcernable therein, then if they had been ſtanding with Iſrael at the red Sea, when they ſaw their enemyes lying dead upon the shore, yea, have we not ground to believe, that the Lord shall make himſelf very evidently knowen in raiſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and acting them forth, which hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeen, and I am ſure the World muſt confeſſe what great things have been done by theſe of whom little was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That the Lord hath thus begun to appear, and make himſelf known to the World in theſe laſt ages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word is a thing very eaſy to demonſtrat, for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it not clear how in theſe laſt times, he hath met his enemyes upon their high places, and in their greateſt ſtrength, that by a ſtrong hand he did make room for his truth, when both Law, and force did withſtand the ſame, and put the marks of his wrath, on ſuch who would oppoſe the ſpreading of his Kingdome, that they have been as viſible, as ſometimes their rage, and violence againſt the Church was, yea, ſince the Lord begun to lift up a ſtandard for the truth, and call forth his People to act, hath it not been ſeen they have loſed their ground more by underhand treaties, and turning aſide to carnall politick shifts then by open force, and violence, vvhich the French Maſſacre, vvith other ſad inſtances can vvitnes; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Church hath ſtill loſt leaſt, by greateſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have vve not ſeen by vvhat dreadful shakings, and alterations of the earth, this late glorious reformation of the Church from Antichriſtianiſme hath been ushered in, vvhich hath been more ſtrange, and frequent, then in many ages before; hath not the Lord cauſed the Nations shake, and the earth to reel like a drunken man, to shevv men that though he ſuffered long in former times of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44187:118"/> Worlds ignorance, he vvill not ſo novv bear vvith oppoſing his truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have vve not alſo ſeen the Lords raiſing up men fit for action, in theſe laſt times, men of a great heroick ſpirit, vvith ſome more then ordinary elevation of the ſame, to appear for his intreſt; ſuch vve may ſay that many former ages could not inſtance, in vvhich the Lords helping his People to do great things, his ſuiting them vvith endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſervice, and vvork of the time, hath been moſt diſcernable? Was not that excellent man the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of France, vvith many others in that place, eminently raiſed up, for the neceſſity of that time, and doe we not find, theſe Princes of Orange William, and Maurice, and Mauritius of Saxony, whom the Lord raiſed againſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the V. and cauſed him flee over the Alpes, yea, what marvellous reſolution, and courage, did attend the actings of the confederates of the Low Countryes, &amp; in latter times doe we not find Guſtavus King of Sweden, Bernard Duke of Weymar, Lantsgrave of Heſſe, with many others eminently raiſed to avenge the Lords quarrel againſt that bloody houſe of Auſtria, have we not alſo ſeen very great inſtrumemts raiſed up in Brittain, and Ireland, (who were followed with wonderful ſucceſſe,) to act for the truth againſt Antichriſtian Prelacy, and truely we muſt ſay the withdrawing in ſuch a meaſure of that ſpirit of courage, and reſolution, which once was ſo viſibly let forth in the firſt dawning of the Reformation, may ſadly point at a great decay of zeal, ſelfe confidence, unfaithfulnes as to the improving of opportunities, for the Lord was with his People, whileſt they were with him, and did ſingly follow him, in his way, but alace, with their departing, it may be ſaid their ſtrength hath departed from them, however, the quarrel is clear for an oppreſſed Peoples acting, upon ſo juſt, ſo neceſſary an account as the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Religion againſt the cruelty and violent encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antichriſt, wherein as the Lord hath eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned his People, ſo, I dare not queſtion he will yet appear, and ſilence the adverſaryes of this truth, by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44187:118"/> ſuch an argument, againſt vvhich they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That unuſual deludge of blood which for the 100 yeares paſt hath overflowed much of Europe can be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to this; that the Lord hath taken peace from men who vvould not embrace the peace of the Goſpel offered in theſe laſt times, and given his enemyes who had shed the blood of the ſaints, blood to drink in great meaſure. I am ſure poor Germany can prove this, which for 20 years together, was a field of dead men, &amp; France from the dayes of Henry the II. to the eſtablishment of Henry the IV. hovv long vvas the Low Countryes made a ſtage of vvarr, vvhere many a cruell Spanjard did fall under the ſvvord of an avenging God, beſids the late bloody vvarres in Brittain, and Ireland, and vvhat doth this declare, but that Jeſus Chriſt hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the fields, and it vvil not be novv vvith the Kings of the earth, to oppreſſe his Church, and withſtand the truth as in former times.</p>
               <p>I shall but adde, hovv vvonderfully hath the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in delivering his Church at the greateſt extremity, hath turned his enemyes counſels and deſignes upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, brought about the great vvorks of theſe laſt times by meanes ſo unexpected, and improbable, that vve may ſay, as to vvhat of his judgement is already execute againſt Antichriſt, hath been no leſſe marvellous then that Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes vvals should fall at the ſound of a trumpet of ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, or a cake of barley bread tumbling into the hoſt of Midian should ſmite, and overthrow the ſame, ſurely when we conſider, what the Lord hath done, and how exactly that doth anſwer the Scripture we may have much to confirm us, anent the further accomplishment of his word, and be aſſured that the term of his long ſuffering towards Babylon is at an end, war is denounced, and the execution already begun, which muſt not have a cloſe untill judgement be accomplished into vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:44187:119"/>IV. Ground which may confirm the faith of the ſaints, and be as a pledge in their hand of the full accomplishing of the Scripture, yea, that this is near is this, that <hi>the day is now turned and that prophecyed victory which the Church should have over Antichrist before the end, is not only begun, but in a great meaſure advanced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a great confirmation when we ſee ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous a criſis in the Churches caſe, her recovery from ſo deſperat, and hopeleſſe a diſeaſe, already begun, that it shall be furder perfected, we are made to wonder at the greatnes of theſe things yet promiſed, but why should we not alſo wonder at that which God hath already done for his Church in our dayes, the Scripture doth shew that Antichriſts ruin muſt begin by the word, that this ſtroke shall be gradual, and however, that great work of God meet with much oppoſition, yet, it shall no more go back in the whole, and muſt we not ſay in all this the word is fulfilled, it hath not hitherto failed the Church, but the event in every circumſtance made to anſwer to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now to clear this we would conſider theſe two. Firſt, that the Churches victory over Antichriſt is this day ſo farr advanced. 2. How the Lords very immediat hand hath been moſt diſcernable therein.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt I need but name whileſt it is ſo manifeſt, what the Lord hath wrought for his Church, for we have ſeen Kingdomes, and Nations, ſubject themſelves to the truth, the kingdome of Antichriſt grow dark, with the breaking up of the light, and many of his followers made to gnash their teeth, being ſcorched with the heat and power of the goſpel, in how great a meaſure is that intereſt now shaken, if we conſider, what the Lord hath wrough, what a great reformation hath been in Brittain &amp; Jreland, through much of France, Germany, Sueden, the Low Countries, Pole, Denemark, yea, even in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, &amp; Tranſilvania, ſure this was a great work, which should be marvellous inour eyes, how that Antichriſtian
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44187:119"/> Empire contrived with ſuch wiſdome underpropt with ſo great ſtrength, whoſe commands not long ſince were receaved as Oracles, with an avv, and reſpect onely due to God hath in ſuch a meaſure begun to fall before the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the word. O the righteous judgement of the Lord. which he hath shewed forth upon that adverſary, and should be a pledge to us of the further manifeſtation thereof, an adverſary we may ſay the greateſt that ever the Church had, whoſe little finger hath been ſorer, then the loins of all who went before, if we conſider his cruelty over mens bodyes, tyrannie over their conſcience, with ſo long a continuance of that tryal; in reſpect of whom it may be ſaid Pharaoh was an eaſy taskmaſter, Antiochus, and the Roman Emperours milde, who for neer 1200 year did carry on a deſpeart, and bloody war againſt the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Second which I would at ſome more length follow forth is this, <hi>how the Lords hand and ſomething of an extraordinary providence hath been no leſſe diſcernable in this late raiſing of the Church, and her begun victory over Antichriſt then in the Firſt planting of Chriſtianity by the Apoſtles,</hi> this is a truth which to many may ſeem ſtrange, but when ſeriouſly conſidered, if prejudice do not darken mens judgement, will appear from ſure and ſolid grounds; now to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat this I would here offer ſome very convincing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which may help to ſtrengthen the faith of the Godly, and give Atheiſme ſome dash.</p>
               <p>FIRST Witnes to this truth is <hi>that wonderful ſucceſſe which the Goſpel in theſe laſt times hath had,</hi> wherein men muſt ſee, the great power of God, and efficacy of the Spirit, in ſome meaſure as manifeſt, as in the firſt riſe of the Chriſtian Church, if we conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From what a ſmall ſpark, ſo great a fire did break up which in a short time put Europe in a flame, and made ſo great a change therein, even Luthers appearing againſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44187:120"/> Texelius upon the account of his indulgencies. O but Gods time of working may be oft contraire to our time of expecting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What a ſwift progreſſe did the goſpel have? may we not ſay with wonder can a nation be born at once, yet, this we have ſeen how many Nations and Cityes in one, and the ſame age yea, in leſſe then 40. yeares, was brought in ſubjection to the truth, and theſe inſtruments whom ſcarce any durſt own at firſt, made to ſee great Princes with armyes on the fields for the intereſts of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have we not ſeen Religion propagated by martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no leſſe then in the primitive times, and mens eſſaies to ruin the Church helped it further to grow. O what but a divine power could thus bring gold out of iron, and clay, bring a flowrishing Church out of their ashes, and turn her poiſon to a preſervative, but alace it is ſad that whileſt men were burned for the truth, and reading the Scripture, their affection did alſo burn in reading the ſame, but now with our liberty there is ſo great a decay.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Muſt not the wiſe, and polititians of the World, confeſſe this late encreaſe of the Church is a thing above their reach, moſt croſſe to all their rules, which they cannot ſee how in an ordinary way it could be brought about.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Were not inſtruments moſt unlikely for ſo great a work if we would judge as men, that ſuch a poor handful, as <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Melanchton, Bucere, &amp;c.</hi> should go forth to confront that power which then made the earth to tremble, might it not ſeem as improbable as the ſending forth of ſome fisher men to ſubdue the Nations?</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is knowen they were none of the Rabbies of the time. whoſe repute and fame might have purchaſed eaſy acceſſe to their meſſage, nay they were loaded with all the reproach which their adverſaryes could deviſe, with novelty of doctrine, deceit and falshood in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſented to the World as Monſters, <hi>Luther</hi> was forced to anſwer himſelfe a printed relation of his death, how he was carried away ſoul and body by the Devil.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:44187:120"/>7. Was not the meſſage they carried moſt oppoſit to mens carnal inclinations, to theſe principles they had ſuckt in from their infancy, to the religion of their Fathers, yea, in a word, had no outward encouragements, the whole World ſeemed to combine againſt them; <hi>Luther,</hi> at his firſt appearance excommunicated by the Pope, proſcribed by the Emperour, and good <hi>Melanchton</hi> was oft made to faint, when he thought on ſo great a ſpeat of oppoſition, ſo that without the convoy of an extraordinary power, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have looked more improbable.</p>
               <p>SECOND. Witnes that may let the World ſee a wonderful providence in this late raiſing of the Church is this, <hi>theſe sharp aſsaults which the Church met with from a party, no leſse cruel, and powerfull then any adverſary which the Church had in the primitive times,</hi> for I am ſure the World muſt confeſſe that no ordinary mean had wanted for an eſſay to crush the goſpel in its firſt budding forth, that both counſel, and force, the authority of law, bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vvhith greateſt rage and violence in its execution, yea, the power of the Princes of the earth was put forth to the utmoſt, to withſtand this great work of God in theſe laſt ages, to clear this I shall only point at ſome remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable aſſaults which did tryſt the dauning of the goſpel that may shew ſomething above nature going alongſt with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find a Spanish Emperour devoted to the popish intereſt, more powerful then any who went before, brought in on Germany with the very firſt breaking up of the light, which might ſeem a dreadful let to the Goſpels ſpreading.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The riſe of the Boores, and Anabaptiſt party, whoſe way being ſo groſſe, deſtructive to civil order, to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and proprieties of men, did look like a ſad tryſt, and a probable mean to beget much prejudice againſt the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:44187:121"/>3. That ſad overthrow of the Duke of Saxony, and Landgrave of Heſſe, who were ſuch great patriots to the Church, did then threaten the very ruin of the Proteſtant intereſt in Germany.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Councel of Trent where the Popish party had all their politicks on foot in a ſtrong combination, how to ruin the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Interim of Germany a moſt ſubtile contrivance to divide, and thus break the ſtrength of the Proteſtants, was alſo a ſore aſſault, a ſnare to ſome, and cauſe of perſecution to others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Spanish Inquiſition eſtablished through Spain, Italy, and the Low Countreyes, a horrid cruel engine which did reach to prevent the ſmalleſt glancings of the truth:</p>
               <p n="7">7. The French Maſſacre where not only the Admiral, but moſt of the conſiderable Proteſtants vvere through all France in a few dayes cut off, O vvould not this ſeem an irrecoverable ſtroke together with that Catholick league, vvhich did quickly follovv upon the back thereof, a very ſtrong and formidable combination to root out the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intereſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The taking away of Edward the ſixth of England, &amp; eſtablishing of a cruel perſecutor Queen Mary did indeed look like a ſtroke that should root out the Church in that part, and deſtroy that famous plantation of the Goſpel, in its tender grouth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I muſt adde that vvhich vvas as ſore an aſſault to the Church as any, ſo grievous a difference vvhich vvith the firſt breaking up of the vvork of Reformation, did begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt Luther, and Zvvinglius about Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament, yea, came to ſuch an height, and vvith ſo great heat, and animoſity vvas follovved, as in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vvould have vvholly fruſtrat the vvork they vvere about.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:44187:121"/>
               <p>THIRD. Witnes to this truth is <hi>that wonderful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and reſolution of the Saints, yea, with much chearfulnes in their greateſt ſufferings, which in theſe late times did appear.</hi> Wherein the World muſt confeſſe that ſame immediat ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from Heaven, yea, the Lords owning his People in a very extraordinary way, was no leſſe manifeſt, then in theſe primitive ſufferings of the Church from heathens. Sure no by paſt times, even in theſe bloody dayes of Nero, Domitian, &amp;c. can shew more horrid, more ſtrange engines of torment, and cruelty then what in theſe laſt ages the Church did endure, from the Popish party, whoſe ſavage, and barbarous uſage of the poor flock of Chriſt, where ever they had acceſſe, may witnes a cruelty more then humane, and as to the number, are they not almoſt without reckoning, who in France, Germany, Brittain, and the Low Countries, beſide other parts, were ſlain within this 150. Yeares, for the word of God, and the teſtimony of his truth. Now as this is moſt manifeſt it is alſo known what a divine, and an invincible ſpirit vvith an aſtonishing courage, and reſolution, did appear in the carriage of the People of God, under this ſore perſecution, hovv they triumphed over their oppreſſours, and did chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully meet death in its moſt terrible shape, a thing vvhich the Schooles of Socrates, and Plato, vvith all their rules could never reach, yea, should be reckoned, amongſt the miracles of theſe later dayes, anent vvhich vve vvould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſomething more then nature, a ſpirit, and reſolution above the ordinary rate of men, yea, ſomething much above themſelves, their natural temper, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition did in their moſt extream ſufferings oft appear, and this without the leaſt shadow of affectation, and deceit, I am ſure the World in theſe laſt ages, yea, the conſcience of their perſecutors, and of the greateſt Atheiſts muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That many of the moſt ſoft, tender diſpoſition, many women whoſe complexion would declare more
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44187:122"/> weaknes, yet in this late Antichriſtian perſecution, did en dure greateſt torments, and by ſuffering triumphed over the fury, and rage of their adverſaryes, whereof we have many inſtances in record.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The World hath been alſo a witnes how ſerious, and deliberat the Saints were in this, that they made ſuffering their choiſe, which they could eaſily have shunned, at the rate of yeelding ſomething in the truth, but ere they would doe this, or give the adverſary ſuch a bribe, they choiſed to embrace death, and goe to a ſtake for Chriſt, even when they wanted not moſt perſwading offers to turn them aſide: for inſtance I would here mention that excellent man in Queen Maryes time Julius Palmer who not only had life, but preferment offered if he would recant, to which his anſwer was, that he had quit his living in two places for Chriſt, and now was ready to yeeld his life alſo on that accompt: likewiſe one William Hunter, whom Bishop Bonar did urge with many offers to recant, told him it muſt be Scripture arguments, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fwaſions of that kinde, for he reckoned all earthly things, but droſſe, and dung in reſpect of Chriſt, and at the ſtake when a pardon by the Sheriffe was offered upon ſuch an accompt, did peremptorly reject the ſame. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Riceto a Venetian when condemned for the truth had a large offer to have his patrimony reſtored, which was much morgadged with debt, and made free, beſide his life, if he would but a little yeeld, and likevviſe had his ſon vveeping on him for that cauſe gave this anſvver he vvas reſolved to loſe both Children, and eſtate for Chriſt. I shall adde vvhat vve have related of one Hervvin, vvho ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the lovv countryes, to vvhom the Magiſtrates made great intreaties vvith large promiſes to recant, which he vvholly ſlighted, many more inſtances of this kinde here might be ſet dovvn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is knowen, that ſuch who were of great repute in the World, and had a large share of outward things to tempt them, did in theſe laſt times moſt chearfully part with the ſame, and choiſe rather ſuffering for the truth:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44187:122"/> we may inſtance theſe 2. great witneſſes Iohn Frederick of Saxony, and the Lantſgrave of Heſſe, who under that long impriſonment by Charles the 5. bare out many sharp aſſaults both by threatnings and offers, without yeelding in the leaſt to the prejudice of the truth, yea, on this accompt did the <hi>Duke of Sanony</hi> forgoe with his eſtate, and dignity. <hi>Annas Du Burg</hi> counſellour of the Parliament at Paris of great parts, and repute, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Henry the II. had an excellent ſpeech in Parliament, for the Proteſtant party, for which by him being impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did forgoe all his honours, and intereſts in the World, which otherwayes he might have brooked, and embraced death for Chriſt. The Prince of Condee at the maſſacre of Paris, when the King expreſly shewed him he should within 3 dayes dye, if he did not renounce his Religion, told him, his eſtate, and life were in his hand, but ere he renounced the truth he would quite both.

This old <hi>Mr Row of Carnock</hi> being then a miniſter in the ſame Presbitery ſets down under his hand vvhich he moſt certainly knew.</p>
               <p>I shall only adde 2 remarkable inſtances of the Lords judgement, vvithin theſe few yeares that should not be paſt without a remark.</p>
               <p>The firſt, relats to a conſiderable family in this countrey, who made it their vvork to trouble, and perſecute the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of that Parish, an eminently holy, and faithfull
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44187:128"/> man, yea, upon the accompt of his faithfulnes; the old Laird of that houſe, out of malice doth purſue him vvith a falſe libel before the Sinod uſing all means he could to reproach his name, having it as his deſign, either to get him broken, and put out of the Parish, or at leaſt to crush his ſpirit, and vveaken him in the exerciſe of the miniſtry; but doth there meet vvith a diſappointment, the Lord cleir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innocence of his ſervant, and the malice of the other, ſo that even ſuch who otherwayes wanted not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice at him, were forced to acknowledge this, at which time that Gentleman, whileſt he went to the ſtable where his horſes were, being then at the Sinod upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, is in the place ſtricken with ſicknes, forced to haſte home and take bed and there ſeiſed with ſuch horrour of conſcience, which made him oft cry, intreating moſt earneſtly for his Miniſter whom he had thus perſecuted, and oft had theſe words, <hi>O to ſee his face,</hi> yea told his friends that if he would not come to him, they would cauſe carry him to his houſe, but his Lady out of malice did in a moſt rude, and violent way hinder the Miniſters acceſſe to him, and thus that poor Gentleman in great horrour, and anguish dyeth: after his death his Lady doth ſtill perſue the quarrel with no leſſe malice until she alſo falleth ſick, and therewith had much terrour upon her conſcience, yea, did no leſſe cry out for the Miniſter, then her husband, who then was providentially abſent, ſo that she was put to cry, and in that denyed, which she did hinder to her poor husband, though at laſt, he came to her before her death, to whom shee vvith much bitternes confeſſed her vvrong. After this a young man their chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, vvho had been engadged by them to appear as a vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes againſt that godly man vvas ſo terrified in his conſcience that he could get no reſt until he vvent to the next Sinod, to acknovvledge that horrid ſin, in bearing falſe vvitnes againſt his Miniſter, but being there keept by ſome from a publick appearance, he vvent to another part of the countrey, vvhere it is certainly reported he dyed diſtracted. Novv laſt of all the young Laird vvho did ſucced in that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44187:129"/> eſtate, vvould needs purſue the quarrel, and finding more acceſſe through the change of the time, did ſo endeavour vvith ſome vvho vvere in povver, that an order vvas paſt for banishing him out of that Parish, and though he vvas then othervvayes ſtaged, upon the accompt of the publick cauſe, yet, it vvas knovvn the violent purſuit of that Gentleman vvas the main cauſe of this ſentence, vvhich theſe vvho had hand in paſſing it did themſelves confeſſe, for he had ſolemnly ſvvorn, that if he lived in that place, that man should not be Miniſter there, but lo a fevv dayes after, having returned to his houſe, and boaſting, hovv he had keept his vvord, and novv got his Miniſter caſt out of the parish, he vvas ſuddenly ſtruck by the Lord vvith an high fever, vvhich plucked him avvay in the very ſtrength of his yeares. This I had related as it is here ſet down, from a grave Chriſtian, the party himſelfe being preſent, which he did humbly decline to relate, though he could not but aſſent thereto.</p>
               <p>Second is one David Mackbryar who was a member of the late Parliament being one of the commiſſioners of the Burrowes, a man moſt notour in the countrey where he lived for a leud, and groſſe practice, but moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable and knowen beyond others, for his violence, and rage againſt the Godly, as he shewed by his carriage, both in the Parliament, and afterwards where he could have acceſſe did ſet himſelfe to trouble, and perſecute ſuch under that reproachful name of fanaticks, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome time thereafter whileſt he was forced to retire by reaſon of debt, for fear of caption, he was found one day walking alone by one who was then comed out of the North to that countrey, and had riden forth, to ſee if he could catch any of that party whom he judged was then lurking, and ſuppoſing upon his rencounter that he was ſurely one of theſe, would needs apprehend him, but he upon his reſiſtance, and ſtrugling againſt him was by him run through with a ſword, and immediatly killed on the place, upon that very accompt, and perſwaſion, that he was a phanatick, and rebel as he then tearmed him,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44187:129"/> thus he who had declared himſelf an enemy to the people of God whom he was wont in reproach to call phanaticks, was himſelf under that very notion, and upon that ground cutted down by one of his own ſtamp, and principles. O was not this the finger of God, and a convincing proof of his righteous jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement.</p>
               <p>FIFTH Witnes which holds forth the Lords emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent appearing, and ſomething of an extraordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, in the late raiſing, and reformation of the Church from Antichriſtianiſme, is this <hi>that large meaſure of the Spirit, and outletting thereof which did convincingly follow the Goſpel and miniſtry of the word in theſe laſt times</hi> a truth which we muſt ſay, hath been manifeſt and by many ſolemn proofes thereof demonſtrat, no leſſe then in the firſt planting of the chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>It is undenyable how great a witnes to the truth, the Spirit, &amp; down-powring thereof is, for this is Gods own ſeal, which is not put to a lye, or falſehood, thus he beares witnes to his work in the hearts of his people, and by this alſo the Lord doth ſeal, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the doctrine of the Church, and commiſſion of his ſervants who publisheth the ſame, yea, at ſome ſpecial ſeaſons, when the truth hath leaſt countenance, or encouragement from without, times of contradiction, when men will not receive its teſtimony, and a great ſpeate of oppoſition is to the Goſpel, then hath this in a more full and large measure been diſcernable, thus did the Lord eminently own, and confirm the Chriſtian Religion in the dayes of the Apoſtles, and for ſome following ages, by ſo great a downpowring of the Spirit, ſuch viſible, and extraordinary effects thereof, as did then aſtonish the World, and force men to confeſſe ſomething above nature, that this was ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the great work, and power of God; and have we not alſo cauſe to ſay, that thus the Lord hath born
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44187:130"/> a very ſolemn teſtimony to his truth, the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and doctrine of the reformed Churches in theſe late times; anent which I dare appeal by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, yea, the adverſaryes to their conſcience, if without shutting their eyes, they could shift the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a convincing appearance of God in the power, and efficacy of the Spirit, even in a more then ordinary way, accompanying the word, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a power which carried kingdomes, and cityes before it, yea in a very short time over the belly of greateſt violence, and oppoſition: to clear this a little I shall point at ſome few remarkable evidences, which might ſtare the groſſeſt of men in the face, and in ſome meaſure convince them of this truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident that marvellous conqueſt which the Goſpel had in Germany, by the miniſtry of <hi>Luther, Melanchton, Bucer, Martyr, Muſculus,</hi> and a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of theſe excellent inſtruments whom the Lord then ſent forth, O was not this a day of the Spirit, and powring forth thereof in a large meaſure, a day of the goſpels triumph, not by might, or by power, yet ſuch as before it the World could not ſtand, cityes and countryes might then be ſaid to be born at once the arme of the Lord revealed with the ſame, that men were either ſcorched, or truely warmed and gained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Did not that marvellous power, and efficacy of the ſpirit alſo attend the miniſtry of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius,</hi> in Zurick, and Baſile, when ſo through a reformation followed, to the throwing down of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, abolishing of the Maſſe by publick authority notwitſtanding of its long continuance; and this in a short time; the ſpirit, and power of God did very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appear alſo, in theſe famons plantations of the Goſpel by the Miniſtry of <hi>Calvine, Farel,</hi> and <hi>Vires</hi> in Geneva, Lauſanna, and other adjacent Provinces. It is written in the life of <hi>Vires,</hi> that at <hi>Lyons</hi> which was a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44187:130"/> great populous city, he preached in an open place, where divers thouſands were converted to the truth, yea, ſome who came by with no purpoſe to hear, only out of curioſity ſtepped in, were ſo wrought on, and overcome with the power of the word, as for that time made them neglect their other buſineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That great ſucceſſe which did attend the miniſtry of Mr <hi>Wishart</hi> in Scotland can alſo witnes this truth, whence ſo marvellous a change did quickly follow, in theſe places where he preached through <hi>Angus, Lothian,</hi> and the weſtern parts, yea, how much the ſpirits of the people, were then raiſed and affected with the word, but this being a thing ſo known from the hiſtoryes of that time, I only name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides theſe which are more known, and upon publick record, I muſt here inſtance a very ſolemn, and extraordinary outletting of the ſpirit, which about the year 1625. and thereafter was in the Weſt of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whileſt the perſecution of the Church there was not from the prelatick party; this by the prophane rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that time was called the Stewarton Sicknes, for in that parish firſt, but after through much of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey particularly at Irwine under the miniſtry of famous <hi>Mr Dickson</hi> it was moſt remarkable, where it can be ſaid (which divers Miniſters, and Chriſtians yet alive can witnes) that for conſiderable time, few Sabbaths did paſſe without ſome evidently converted, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proofes of the power of God accompanying his word, yea that many were ſo choaked and taken by the heart, that through terrour, the ſpirit in ſuch a meaſure convincing them of ſin, in hearing of the word, they have been made to fall over, and thus carried out of the Church who after proved moſt ſolid, and lively Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and as it was knowen ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea thus like a ſpreading moor—burn, the power of Godlines did advance from one place to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which put a marvellous luſtre on theſe parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the ſavour whereof brought many from other parts of the land to ſee the truth of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I muſt alſo mention that ſolemn Communion at the Kirk of the Shots 20 June 1630. at which time there was ſo convincing an appearance of God, and downpowring of the Spirit, even in an extraordinary way, that did follow the ordinances eſpecially that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Munday 21 June, with a ſtrange unuſual motion on the hearers, who in a great multitude were there conveened of divers ranks, that it was known, which I can ſpeak on ſure ground, near 500, had at that time a diſcernable change wrought on them, of whom moſt proved lively Chriſtians afterward, it was the ſowing of a ſeed through Clideſdeal, ſo as many of moſt eminent Chriſtians in that countrey, could date either their converſion, or ſome remarkable confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their caſe from that day, and truely this was the more remarkable that one after much reluctance by a ſpecial, and unexpected providence was called to preach that ſermon on the Munday, which then was not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſed, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44187:131"/> years before the fall of Prelacy about the yeare 1628. &amp; ſome yeares thereafter, which as many grave, and ſolid Chriſtians yet alive can witnes, who were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was a bright, and hot ſun-blink of the Goſpel, yea, may with ſobriety be ſaid, to have been one of the largeſt manifeſtations of the Spirit and of the moſt ſolemn times of the downpowring thereof that almoſt ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles hath been ſeen, where the power of God did ſenſibly accompany the word with an unuſual motion upon the hearers, and a very great tack as to the converſion of ſouls to Chriſt, the goings of the Lord then full of Majeſty, and the shout of a King was heard in the ſolemn meetings of his people, that as a judicious old Chriſtian, who was there preſent, did expreſſe it, he thought it was like a dazeling beam, and ray of the glory of God, with ſuch an unuſual bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as even forced by ſtanders to an aſtonishment, a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſaryes. I remember amongſt other paſſages what a worthy Chriſtian told me, how ſometimes in hearing the word, ſuch a power, and evidence of the Lords preſence was with it, that he hath been forced to riſe, and look through the Church, and ſee what the people were doing, thinking from what he felt on his own ſpirit it was a wonder how any could go away without ſome change upon them. And then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was ſweet, and eaſy for Chriſtians to come 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40 miles to theſe ſolemn Communions which they had, and there continue from the time they came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until they returned, without wearying, or making uſe of ſteep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:44187:132"/> yea, but little of either meat, or drink, and as ſome of them profeſſed did not feel the need thereof, but went away moſt fresh, and vigorous, their ſouls ſo filled with the ſenſe of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That was alſo a remarkable time wherein the Lord did let forth much of the Spirit on his people in the year 1638, when this Nation did ſolemnly enter in Convenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhich many yet alive at this day do knovv, hovv the ſpirits of men vvere raiſed, and vvrought on by the vvord, the ordinances lively, and longed after, for then did the Nation ovvn the Lord, and vvas viſibly ovvned by him, much zeal, and an enlarged heart did appear for the publick cauſe, perſonal reformation ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſet about, and then alſo vvas there a remarkable gale of providence that did attend the actings of his people, vvhich did aſtonish their adverſaryes, and forced many of them to feign ſubjection. Alace hovv is our night comed on, for the Lord hath in anger co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the face of the Daughter of Zion vvith a dark cloud.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Muſt not vve alſo ſay, ſince the land vvas engad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Covenant to the Lord in theſe late times, vvhat a ſolemn outletting of the ſpirit hath been ſeen, a large harveſt with much of the fruit of the Goſpel diſcernable, which we may ſay with a warrant, hath been proven in the inbringing of thouſands to Chriſt, a part whereof now are in glory and many yet live who are a viſible ſeal to this truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom I am ſure ſome will not loſe the remembrance of theſe ſweet refreshing times, which the land for ſeveral yeares did enjoy of the Goſpel and of many ſolemn Communions, where a large bleſſing with much of the Spirit, and power of God was felt ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is clear that extraordinary gifts, and enduements have been let forrh to the Church under the New Teſtament, for with the firſt dawning of the Goſpel there was both Apoſtles, and Prophets raiſed up, it cannot be alſo denyed that ſince the Cannon of the Scripture was cloſed, yea, in theſe late ages there hath been very extraordinary men given to the Church, who had ſpecial revelations from the Lord of his minde anent things to come, which though we should not now look after, yet herein did the Lord remarkably condeſcend, when ſome great piece of ſervice, and neceſſity of the Church did more call for it, and truely theſe were led in no other path then that of the word, though they had a more ſpecial diſcovery, and immediat inbreathing of Gods minde as to the application thereof in particular caſes, neither did they preſſe upon mens conſcience to credit the ſame, but were moſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, witneſſing much humble ſobriety on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

I can alſo adde this, from very ſure information (and truely anent any of thoſe particulars, I ſeriouſly ſtudie to have ſatisfying grounds anent the certainty thereof) that it was his uſe even in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44187:134"/> the coldeſt winter nights, to riſe for prayer, and oft times his wife who was an excellent woman, hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to ſeek after him, where he hath been found lying on the ground weeping, and wreſtling with the Lord, yea; ſometimes would have been much of the night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, in the Church of <hi>Aire</hi> on that accompt.

               <p>The firſt was this, that one night whileſt he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Scripture after his ſupper, in the priſon (at his cuſtome was,) whileſt he, with much power; and authority was preſſing home the truth, one of the company who had ſome charge in the Caſtell, fell a jearing, which <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> obſerving, and looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to him, did preſently cloſe the Bible, and ceaſe, and a little after having a drink in his hand, he ſayeth to a friend at the table before all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, there is one ſo profane and groſſe as to contemn and mock at the word of the Lord, but ere a little God shall ſmite him, with a remarkable ſtroke of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which accordingly fell out to the aſtonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the company, for that man did preſently drop down to the ground, and dyed. A lady that was then Popish being preſent by reaſon of a friend of hers that was priſoner in the caſtle, was ſo moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that it proved an help to her after-conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage is this, one <hi>Iohn Steward,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chriſtian who lived at <hi>Aire</hi> having conted to viſit <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> in priſon, found him in a more then ordinary way troubled, and ſad, and upon his enquiry there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent he ſayeth, <hi>Iohn,</hi> ye should not be here, go home to <hi>Aire,</hi> for the plague of God is broken up in that place, and cauſe <hi>Hew Kennedy</hi> proveſt of that toun (who was alſo a very ſingular Chriſtian) conveeh the people to the ſtreets, and pray together, and the Lord shall hear <hi>How Kennedy,</hi> and remove that ſtroke; this at the firſt did ſomething aſtonish the ſaid <hi>Iohn,</hi> and put him to queſtion its truth, having ſo lately comed out of that place, but at his return found it ſo, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44187:135"/> in every thing it fell out as the man of God had shewed.</p>
               <p>After his banishment to which the King did change the ſentence of death paſt upon him at <hi>Linlithgo,</hi> he in a very short time acquired the French tongue, with ſuch a facility therein, as was thought ſtrange by theſe who knew it; Trochrig in his Commentar on the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, ſets down this paſſage how being called to preach at Salmur a famous Univerſity, yea, one of the moſt learned auditors in France, he did with ſuch bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and authority preach, as though he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaneſt congregation, whereat Trochrig being aſtonished, could not but on his acquaintance with him queſtion him thereanent, whence he had ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and was ſo little moved, whileſt he preached before ſtrangers, ſo grave, and judicious an auditory, and in a ſtrange tongue, to whom in a humble way as one more dejected, then lifted up, he gave that anſwer, when he conſidered his being before the Lord, and that he was delivering his meſſage, he could not regard, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great, or ſmall, but all flesh did then go out of his minde.</p>
               <p>Whileſt he was Miniſter at S. Jane de Angeli a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant town in France, where his Miniſtry was much bleſſed with ſucceſſe, the civil warres did break up, where that city was twice beſieged on the Proteſtant intereſt, during which time theſe paſſages fell out moſt remarkable, One was, the town being fore ſtraited, and ready to be taken, the enemyes having raiſed a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and by a cloſe approach had made a great breach in the wall, <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> hearing thereof (who had much encouraged the People, that their adverſaries should not then prevail) went himſelf with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonier up the walls, and deſired he would charge ſuch a piece of cannon, and shoot, for God should direct
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44187:136"/> that shot, and cauſe it proſper, which accordingly did to the aſtonishment of onlookers diſmount that batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Lord ſo ordered things after, that the King did parley on favourable termes with the city, and did only himſelf with his court come in without doing any violence. An other marvellous paſſage was this, the following Sabbath ſome of the godly in that place, fearing <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> his hazard, did ſeriouſly deal with him that he would forbear to go forth, and preach, the Court being there, from which he by no intreaty would be hindred, but shewed them he would adventure to preach the word to his People, and truſt the Lord with what concerned himſelfe, being more grieved at their fear, and deſpondence, and that day had a very great auditory both of friends, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who come upon the fame of ſuch a man, but in time of ſermon, a great man of the Court, with ſome of the Kings own guard was ſent to bring him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with before the King, and whileſt he was entring the Church which had ſome difficulty by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> did turn himſelfe toward that entry, and deſired the People to give way to one of the great Piers of France that was coming in, but after whileſt he was coming near the pulpit, to execut his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by putting force on the ſervant of Chriſt, for his deſiſting, he did with great authority ſpeak to him, before all the People, and in the name of his Maſter Jeſus Chriſt charged him that he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Worship of God; wherewith that man was ſo affrighted that he fell a shaking, yea was forced to crutch down, and make no further trouble. A third paſſage no leſſe remarkable was upon the cloſe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whileſt <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> with much ſubmiſſion, went to the King who was then greatly incenſed, and with a threatning countenance asked, what he was, and how he durſt preach haereſy ſo near his perſon, and with ſuch contumacy carry himſelf, to vvhich vvith due
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44187:136"/> reverence howing himſelf he did anſwer, I am Sir, the Servant, and Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe truth I preached this day, which if your Majeſty rightly knew, ye would have judged it your duety to have comed your ſelf, and heard, and for my doctrine I did this day preach theſe 3 truths to your People. 1. That man is fallen, and by nature in a loſt condition, yea, by his own power, and abilityes is not able to help himſelfe from that eſtate. 2. That there is no ſalvation, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from wrath by our ovvn merits, but by Jeſus Chriſt and his merit alone. 3. I did alſo preach this day the juſt liberties of the Kingdome of France, that your Majeſty ovveth obedience to Chriſt onely, vvho is Head of the Church, and that the Pope, as he is an enemy to Chriſt, and his truth, ſo alſo to the Kings of the earth, vvhom he keepeth under ſlavery to his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped povver. Where at the King for a time keeping ſilence vvith great aſtonishment turned to ſome about him, and ſaid ſurely this is a man of God. Yea, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did commun vvith him, and vvith great reſpect diſmiſſed him. The year follovving vvhileſt the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betvvixt the King, and Proteſtant party did grovv, that city vvas again beſieged, taken, and in part ſacked as <hi>Mr Welsh</hi> did publickly foretel, at vvhich time, it is knovvn, hovv the King paſt a ſolemn or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that none should in the leaſt vvrong <hi>Mr Welsh,</hi> or any thing that belonged to him under higheſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and did after give a ſafe conduct to him, for tranſporting himſelf to England vvhere he died, King James refuſing his return to his ovvn countrey, though earneſtly petioned by his vvife for her husbands health.</p>
               <p>During his ſicknes he vvas ſo filled, and overcome vvith the ſenſible enjoyment of God, that he vvas ſometime overheard in prayer, to have theſe vvords, <hi>Lord, hold thy hand, it is eneugh thy ſervant is a clay veſſel, and can hold no more.</hi>

               <p>Whileſt he vvas in the Miniſtry at Edinburgh he shined as a great light through the vvhole land, the povver and efficacy of the ſpirit moſt ſenſibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the vvord he preached, he vvas a terrour to evil doers, and the authority of God did ſo appear upon him, and his carriage, vvith ſuch a Majeſty in his countenance, as forced fear, and reſpect from the greateſt in the land, even theſe vvho vvere moſt avovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haters of Godlines, yea, it vvas knovvn vvhat an avvful impreſſion King James had of him, and did once give him that teſtimony before many, that he judged <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> vvas vvorthy of the halfe of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>He vvas a man that had much invvard exerciſe about his ovvn perſonal caſe, had been oft aſſaulted anent that great foundation of truth, if there vvas a God, vvhich coſt him many dayes, and nights wreſtling, and vvhen he hath comed up to the pulpit, after being ſometime ſilent, vvhich vvas his uſual vvay, he vvould have ſaid I think it is a great matter to believe there is a God, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the People, it vvas an other thing to believe that then they judged. But it vvas alſo knovvn, by his friends vvith vvhom he vvas familiar, vvhat extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary confirmations he had from the Lord therein, vvhat near familiarity he did attain in his ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe vvith God, yea, truely ſomethings I have had
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44187:137"/> from perſons worthy of credit thereanent, vvould ſeem ſo ſtrange, and marvellous, that I forbear to ſet them dovvn.</p>
               <p>The great ſucceſſe of his Miniſtry at Edenburgh, Innerneſſe, and other places whither providence called him is aboundantly known, whileſt he was confined at Innerneſſe that poor dark countrey was marvellouſly enlightned, many brought in to Chriſt by his Miniſtry, and a ſeed ſown in theſe places, which even to this day is not wholly worn out. I shall here ſet down one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of famous <hi>Mr Henderſon</hi> who at his firſt entry to the Miniſtry at Leuchars, was very prelatick and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of St Andrewes brought in againſt the parishes conſent; ſo that the day of his admiſſion, the Church doores being shut by the People, they were forced to break in by a window to get him entrance, but a little after this, upon the report of a Communion where <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> was to help, he would needs from a longing he had to hear and ſee ſuch a man, go ſecretly there, and placed himſelfe in a dark part of the Church where he might not be known, when <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> was come to the pulpit he did for a conſiderable time keep ſilence as his maner was, which did ſome way aſtonish <hi>Mr Henderſon,</hi> but much more when he heard the firſt vvords where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he begun, which were theſe, <hi>He that cometh not in by the door, but climbeth up another way, the ſame is a thief, and a robber;</hi> Which did by the Lords bleſſing at the very preſent take him by the heart, and had ſo great an impreſſion on him, that it was the firſt mean of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>He was one that had the ſpirit of diſcerning in a great meaſure, did prophetically ſpeak of many things which afterwards came to paſſe, yea, which I had atteſted by ſober, and grave Chriſtians, who were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with him, that divers perſons diſtracted, and of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44187:138"/> theſe who were paſſed all hope of recovery in the falling ſicknes, were brought to <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> and after prayer by him in their behalfe were fully recovered: this indeed may ſeem ſtrange, but it is alſo true, <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> was a great wreſtler who had more then ordinary familiarity with his Maſter.</p>
               <p>A little before his death when he was at Edenbrugh and through weaknes keept his chamber, there was a meeting of divers godly Miniſters at that time there, on ſome ſpecial ground of the Churches concernment, who hearing he was in the town came together, and gave him an account of the actings of theſe times, the Prelats then deſigning the ſervice book, after which <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> prayed, and did therein tell over again to the Lord the very ſubſtance of their diſcourſe, vvhich vvas a ſad repreſentation of the caſe of the Church, at vvhich time there vvas ſuch an extraordinary motion on all preſent, ſo ſenſible a dovvnpovvring of the Spirit, that they could hardly contain themſelves, yea, vvhich vvas moſt ſtrange, even ſome unuſual motion on theſe vvho vvere in other parts of the houſe, not knovving the cauſe at that very inſtant, one <hi>Mr Weemes</hi> of <hi>Lothaker</hi> being then occaſionally preſent, vvhen he vvent avvay, ſaid, O hovv ſtrange a man is this, for he knocked dovvn the Spirit of God on us all, this he ſaid becauſe <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> did divers times knock vvith his fingers on the table; I had this from a vvorthy Chriſtian Gentleman in vvhoſe mothers houſe this vvas.</p>
               <p>He vvas deeply affected vvith the naughtines and prophanity of many Miniſters then in the Church, and the unſuitable carriage of others to ſo great a calling, and did expreſſe much his fear that the miniſtry of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land vvould prove the greateſt perſecutors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that it had. If there vvere a full collection of theſe remarkable paſſages, vvhich have been knovvn to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44187:138"/> in his life, it vvould further vvitnes vvhat an extraordinary man that vvas.

               <p>III. <hi>Mr Davidſone</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel at Salt-Preſtoun, may be truly here inſtanced as one of an extraordinary prophetick Spirit, vvho vvas likevviſe eminently zealous, and faithful for his Maſter in a time of the Churches defection, as Didoclavius in that forementioned preface termes him; <hi>Cato, &amp; Conſtani Cato ſui temporis.</hi> He did then foreſee Prelacyes breaking in upon the Church, vvhen King James vvas preſſing the ſetting up of ſuperintendents under a very ſpecious pretext, and vvas for that end himſelf preſent at the aſſembly in Dundee, having engadged many, alace too many to conſent thereto, but <hi>Mr Davidſone</hi> vvith great boldnes roſe up, and vvarned the aſſembly of the hazard, and told them he ſavv the knave Bishop, vvith his mitre comming in under that mask, yea, did ſolemnly in his own name, and name of the Church of Scotland enter a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation againſt that ſtep of defection, and their yeelding up in ſo far the liberties of the Church to pleaſe men.</p>
               <p>Whileſt he vvas Miniſter at Salt-Preſtoun the building of a Church vvas by him much endevoured vvhich then vvas vvanting, for vvhich he did advance ſo much out of his ovvn privat intereſt, my Lord Nevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batle vvho then had a great intereſt in the Parish en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadging to help it fordvvard, from vvhich he after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and thereby fruſtrated the vvork, Whereupon <hi>Mr Davidſone</hi> told him, theſe vvalls that vvere then
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44187:139"/> begun to be builded, should ſtand as a witnes againſt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ere long God should root out him, and his eſtate out of that Parish, and should not have a piece of land in the ſame, vvhich shorthy after had a viſible accomplishment. It vvas very clear from many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his life that the ſecret of the Lord vvas in an extraordinary vvay vvith him. Some of theſe vvhich have been tranſmitted from theſe vvho parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly knevv the ſame are indeed moſt vvorthy of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>

And it is well knovven what an accomplishment this prediction had.</p>
               <p>Being with <hi>Mr Bruce</hi> one time at dinner who vvas then in great favour vvith the King, he had theſe vvords in giving thanks after meat. Lord, they ſervant here is novv a great favorite of the Court, and in much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but he shall be within a litle as much perſecuted as he is now in favour, and go down the ſtreets, when many who have him this day in eſteem will not give him a ſalutation, vvhich vvas very manifeſt afterwards. And at an other time whileſt <hi>Mr Robert Bruce,</hi> and he were dyning together in the houſe of one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the town, who was then a cordial friend to godly Miniſters, he did alſo in his plain, and free way break forth with theſe words, whileſt he was
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44187:139"/> giving thanks, Lord, this good man hath reſpect for thy ſake to thy ſervants, but he litle knoweth that in a short time he muſt carry us both who are here to priſon, which words did much trouble that honeſt man, though afterwards it came moſt exactly to paſſe.</p>
               <p>There is one more remarkable paſſage which I should fear to ſet, down it is ſo ſtrange, but that I had the ſame confirmed by ſome worthy of credit, who shewed me, that from theſe that were preſent, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with Mr <hi>Davidſone</hi> they had it related. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nearly related to a great family of that Parish, bnt a moſt violent hater of piety, did upon that account beat a poor honeſt man who lived there, having not the feaſt shadow of a provocation, and amongſt other ſore ſtrokes gave one upon the back with theſe words, take this for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr <hi>Davidſons</hi> ſake, after which the honeſt man was for a time forced to keep his bed, and complained moſt of that ſtroke which he gave him on the back, as that which he felt more then all the reſt; but the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath following, <hi>Mr Davidſon</hi> ſpeaking in the cloſe of his Sermon anent the oppreſſion of the godly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which wicked men had to ſuch, did very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly touch that late inſtance, ſaying, it was a ſad time, whileſt a prophane man would thus openly adventure to vent his rage againſt theſe who were ſeekers of God in the place, whileſt he could have no cauſe but the very appearance of his image, and with great authority ſaid, he who hath done this, were he the Laird, or the Lairds brother, ere a few dayes paſſe, God shall give him a ſtroke that all the Monarches of the earth dare not challenge, which was then publickly known how in the cloſe of that very week, ſtanding before his dore, he was ſtruck dead with a thunder bolt and all his bones crusht.</p>

We have there held forth, how after that bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by an order from the Duke of Savoy, a ſmall number was in a remarkable way raiſed up, and upon their firſt eſſay 7 or 8 under the conduct of that worthy Gentleman <hi>Ioſua Gianavell</hi> (whom God made uſe of as a choiſe inſtrument, to help that poor ſcattered remnant) was made to fight 300 ſouldiers who were ſent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerce further cruelty in that place, killing many of them and purſueing the reſt for a conſiderable time. After, a party of 500 being ſent by the Marqueſſe of Fianem who then commanded the Duke of Savoyes forces, were oppoſed by 11 of the Proteſtants, and other 6 with ſlings, and after a short conflict were forced to flee with conſiderable ſlaughter, the terrour of the Lord upon the one, and a Spirit of courage and reſolution in the other being very manifeſt.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44187:150"/> was like a riddle with ſo many lakes, yea, the rudder of the Ship breaking, ſo that the Pilots were turned wholly hopeleſſe, and could not ſee any ground of ſafety in an ordinary way, a poor ſea man by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providence, whoſe company they had much shunned was made the inſtrument of preſerving the whole veſſel, with a marvellous dexterity faſtening the rudder, which others had given over, as one viſibly ſent by the Lord for that end. 2. The ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that ſome of theſe worthy Miniſters had of their ſafety, which with great confidence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before the paſſengers, whileſt the Pilot, and others were giving it over as a hopeleſſe buſſineſſe, and ſeeing a convincing neceſſity for a return though it was very aſtonishing, and bitter at the firſt look, yet was: afterwards followed with a clear diſcovery from the Lord, as one of them with much freedom did expreſſe his aſſurance to the reſt of his brethren, that ſince the Lord would not accept their ſervice in America, they should not want work, and ſervice, whither he was ſending them back by ſo remarkable a providence, as within a short time was evident, the downfal of the Prelats in Scotland and after in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land tryſting shortly upon the back thereof, ſo that it may be ſaid this was a convincing preſage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Lord by a ſtrong hand bringing back ſuch choiſe, and uſeful inſtruments for that great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt vvhich did after follovv, ſo that they could not but ſay, the Lord did in a very marvellous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat vvay appear in that croſſe vvind, and ſtorm, and thereby as if vvith an audible voice did vvitnes his minde in ſuch a diſappointment. 3. It vvas alſo moſt obſervable that none of theſe vvho on the account of their conſciences, that they might enjoy the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ordinances, vvent in that journey vvas the vvorſe, but had a ſafe return, only ſome perſons vvho upon another account, expecting a fat ſoil, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

               <p>I muſt here alſo ſet down a very ſingular, and ſtrange inſtance, we may ſay both of judgement and mercy which was in this land, not many yeares ago, a Gentleman whoſe ſtyle was <hi>Waſtraw</hi> a moſt bloodyman, and otherwayes notour for profanity, but moſt in this, that it vvas his great vvork, and pleaſure to put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betvvixt men, and as it vvas at that time very eaſy to engadge them in blood, vvhileſt he had thus ſtirred up a neighbour Gentleman to kill an other in that place, finding him after ſore troubled in mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, he told him more of that practice vvould be the beſt cure, for he himſelf had killed 6, and at the firſt time was much diſquieted, but the longer he did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, it became the more eaſy. But one day vvhileſt he vvas on ſuch an account riding to a place vvhere 2 had tryſted to decide a privat quarrel by fighting, his horſe ſtumbles on the ſide of a ſteep rock, and he falls a great vvay dovvn, his ſvvord falling out before him, yet vvithout any hurt; and here by ſuch a ſtrange piece of providence did the Lord tryſt and break in upon his conſcience, ſo that he quits his journey turns home vvith great trouble and remorſe, a moſt kindly change follovving thereon, and for ſome yeares after vvitneſſed much tendernes and repentance by his after vvalk, ſpent much time alone mourning before his death, and that day he dyed having no viſible appearance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to theſe vvho looked on, he vvas heard in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber much vvreſtling in prayer, and after long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, theſe of the houſe vvere forced to break up the

               <p>What an obſervation pasſage is that alſo, knovvn to many yet alive, anent a notorious robber in the ſouth parts of this land, called <hi>Iohn of the Score</hi> who for many years having driven that woefull trade did one day ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a poor man travelling with 2 horſes which he according to his cuſtome takes away, the poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman falling down on his knees, did earneſtly beg, that for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, he would give the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for he had no more to maintain his poor family, but what he could gain by them, but it was in vain, he carryeth them home with him, leaving the poor man in that deſolate condition, but a little after, he turns dumpish, and melancholy, could get no reſt, or quiet not knowing the cauſe, but as he profeſſed, that theſe words the poor man had ſpoke to him, (though he was ſo great an Atheiſt, that he underſtood not what he meant when he ſpake of Chriſt) were lying like a heavy weight upon his ſpirit, and whileſt he was ſought after for his robberies he deſired his ſonnes to shift for themſelves, for he could not go out of the vvay, there being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him, and ſomething vvithin him that in a kinde bound him from going out of the way, and thus ſtayed at his houſe until he was apprehended, brought in to Edinburgh and there put up in priſon, upon which a godly Miniſter <hi>Mr Henry Blyth,</hi> with a Chriſtian Gentleman <hi>William Cunir ghame Tutor of Bonitoun</hi>

               <p>An other notable inſtance of grace, vvith a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage in his condition, I shall here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one <hi>Patrick Mackelwrath</hi> vvho lived in the vveſt parts of Scotland vvhoſe heart the Lord in a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable vvay touched, and after his converſion, as he shevved to many of his Chriſtian friends vvas in ſuch a frame ſo affected vvith that nevv World vvherein he vvas entred, the diſcoveries of God, and of a life to come, that for ſome moneths together he did ſcarce ever ſleep but vvas ſtill taken up in vvondring, his life vvas very remarkable for tenderneſſe, and near converſe vvith God in his vvalk, and vvhich vvas vvorthy to be noticed, one day after a sharp tryal, having his only ſon ſuddenly taken avvay by death he retired alone for ſeveral houres, and vvhen he came forth did look ſo chearfully
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44187:152"/> that to thoſe who asked him the reaſon thereof, &amp; vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the ſame in ſuch a time, he told them he had got that in his retirement vvith the Lord, that to have it afterwards renewed he would be content to loſſe a ſon every day. This one remarkable paſſage I would ſet down, it had been long his burden the want of memory that he could retain almoſt nothing of what he heard from the word, and bitterly complaining thereof to worthy Maſter James English Miniſter of Daly, his counſel to him was when he heard any truth which he deſired to remember, to hold it up to the Lord, and deſire him to keep it for him, and give him it back according to his need, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this bleſſed man did with much ſeriouſnes practice, and on his death bed, to his Miniſter, and divers Chriſtians that were preſent, he did ſolemnly declare how wonderfully the Lord had anſvvered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to him in that particular, for as they knew how much formerly it had been his burden, the want of memory, now the Lord had given him back all theſe truths that he had put in his keeping, ſo that what for many yeares before he had heard, was now moſt clearly brought to his remembrance, which he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by repeating many particular truths, and notes of Sermons which at ſuch, and ſuch times he had heard.</p>
               <p>Now to shut up this, we have truely cauſe to ſay even from late experience ſince this dark night came upon the Church in theſe Nations, with ſo sharp a ſtorm of perſecution, there hath not wanted ſome very ſignal, and convincing providences witneſſing the Lords appearance for his People, and againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes; which are worthy of a remark, and may let men ſee that there is one higher then the higheſt, who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Kingdomes of the Children of men, for it is manifeſt.</p>

How eminently the Lord did appear in breaking that party vvho had been the great inſtruments both in Counſel, and Action to break the governement of the Church of Chriſt in this land, and lay ſo much of his vineyeard waſte, and deſolate, and this, in the height of their povver, and greatnes, vvhileſt they ſeemed moſt firmly rooted. O hovv evident vvas a divine hand there, that this Cabbal vvho made it their great work to raiſe up Prelacy, and oppreſſe the poor Church, and like a violent tempeſt did carry all before them, in a moment, vvhen they could have leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, should be made to fall, yea, in ſo short a time be turned out of their places, and offices, who but a little before had turned out ſo many of the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, and that great man, who put forth his power and authority ſo much to turn many of the godly of the Land both Miniſters and others, out of their houſes and familyes, toſſing them from place to place, should thus be dealt with from the Lord, and recompenced vvith that meaſure, being forced to quite his lodging once, and again, yea, even to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himſelf out of the countrey, vvho had been the chief inſtrument to banish ſome of the moſt choiſe ſervants of Chriſt, and this ſtroke alſo made to tryſt them from that hand whence they could have leaſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, whoſe intereſt they ſtudied to promote in oppoſition to Gods; truely I should deſire to ſtudy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and fear in application of the judgements of God, but vvhen the Lord doth ſo clearly reveal himſelf and shevv forth ſuch an evident reſemblance, betvvixt mens ſins, and their ſtroke, it cryeth aloud for a ſerious obſerving thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Should vve paſſe without a remark ſo ſolemn 2 vvitnes from the Lord of his reſpect to his Peoples ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in this late time? for it is knovvn, vvith vvhat marvellous reſolution, and chearfulnes, theſe have

I shall onely adde, we have much ground in theſe times to believe that the Lord shall yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and make himſelf known in the earth, by as great, and convincing providences both of judgement and mercy, as in any former ages, and thus vindicat his glory, and refute the Atheiſme of this generation, by ſuch an argument, as shall force iniquity to ſtop its mouth.</p>
               <p>Now ſince this is ſure, which none can get denyed if they will but allow ſome ſerious thoughts thereanent, that the Scripture falleth not to the ground, for <hi>Gods way is perfect and his word is tryed,</hi> Pſ. 18: <hi>ver.</hi> 30.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44187:154"/> eternal ſalvation, the teſtimony of the God of truth might be ſufficient ſecurity for the ſame, it is a ſmall matter how this World doth reel, and ſtagger, or what be the changes of outward things, that is eneugh, the promiſes of the Word shall certainly take place and the expectation of the Saints shall not make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed.</p>
